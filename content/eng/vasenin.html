 Valeriy Aleksandrovich Vasenin
  </p>

   <p>Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (Sc.D., Phys. and Math.); professor of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics; 
    head of the department of Information Security Institute; head of the laboratory of Institute of mechanics, Lomonosov Moscow State University.</p>

   <p>Vasenin V. A. was born in 1948 in Kurovskoe, Moscow Region. After finishing school in 1967,   
     he entered the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, Lomonosov Moscow State University. He graduated from 
     it in 1972. In 1977 he completed his postgraduate study and defended the Cand's dissertation and got his Ph.D. 
    In the same year he was hired by the Theoretical Mechanics Department, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, 
    Lomonosov Moscow State University at first as an assistant and then as an associate professor. 
    Since 1996 he works as a part-time lecturer at the Computational Mathematics Department, since 2000 - 
    as a professor. In 1981 V. A. Vasenin accepted the post of the Institute of Mechanics 
    laboratory's head. From 1992 to 2001 he worked as a deputy prorector of MSU and as the head of Telecommunications 
    and Internet Technologies Center. In November 2002 Vasenin moved to RAS's Scientific Communications and 
    Information Technologies Center and worked here as a deputy director, and in June 2005, after Center's reorganization, 
    he returned to his main job in MSU as a head of the department in Information Security Institute.</p>

  <p>In 1998 V.A. Vasenin got his degree of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (Sc.D., Phys. and Math.).</p>

  <p>V. A. Vasenin is an expert in Mathematical Methods, secure networks and data-processing knoware and software. 
   He is an author of 257 scientific researches, including 13 monographs.</p>

  <p>V. A. Vasenin got the following scientific results, which later found practical use in Russia:
  
   <ul>
    <li>Theoretical justification of the Internet networks (from traditional to high-speed integrated services 
     digital networks) construction and development principles. These principles where implemented during the 
     creation of the dynamically developing segments of the national academic network.</li>
   <li>Development and implementation of the mathematical models, methods of construction and maintenance 
    distributed applications based on GRID-like heterogeneous environments.</li>
   <li>Creation of theoretical basis, construction and effective practical usage of a big network structures monitoring models.</li>
   <li>Implementation of new service quality management models and scenarios for resource-intensive Internet applications.</li>
   <li>Development and implementation of the new approach in the automated dynamic program multisequencing. </li>
   <li>Development of new models, algorithms and software tools for a semistructured data thematic analysis. 
   Sources of such data are placed in a big (enterprise) and giant-scale (Internet) repositories.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>

  <p>V. A. Vasenin is a laureate of the Russian Federation Government Prize for scientific and institutional framework 
   development and creation of the university network RUNnet.</p>
  <p>Nowadays V. A. Vasenin works as a professor (part-time) of Computational Mathematics Department, supervises 
    students and postgraduate students scientific work, conduct scientific seminars <a href="http://seminar.s2s.msu.ru">http://seminar.s2s.msu.ru</a>) 
   and teaches special courses.</p>
 <p> Under his supervision 100 specialists were educated, 20 got their Ph.D. and 2 got their Sc.D. degrees.  </p>
 <p>V.A. Vasenin is a member of editorial boards of such magazines as "Information Technology", "Informatics problems", "Software Engineering"; he is 
   also a member of the coordinating council of RAS for Science Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure, expert councils of RFBR, 
   Federal Information Technology Agency and a number of others.</p>
