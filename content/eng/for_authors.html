        We  invite you to participate as an author in the journal "Software Engineering"</em>.</span></p>
        <p class="main_content_subtitle">GUIDELINES  FOR AUTHORS</p>
        <p>Submitted  articles must correspond to the topics of the journal "Software Engineering"  and include new research findings,
          not  previously published and not intended for publication in any other print or  electronic media.
          The  following materials are to be submitted to the journal for article publication:
          <ul>
            <li>manuscript in DOC and  PDF formats</li>
            <li>tables, illustrations  and a list of captions</li>

position, job title, phone numbers and email</li>
            <li>expert opinion on the  possibility of publishing the article in the press</li>
            <li>information in English  containing the article data required for indexing the journal in
international scientometric  databases.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>If  the article is sent by mail parcel, then it is necessary to enclose a disk with  an electronic version of these materials.
          All  articles are subject to mandatory peer review (see review form).

        <p class="main_content_subtitle">RULES FOR PREPARATION </p>
        <p>          Size  of the manuscript proposed for publication shall be not less than 10 and not  more than 20 pages

       with  Times New Roman font size 14 pt.
          The  specified size of articles includes: text, appendices, illustrations, tables  and a reference list. In some cases,
       by the decision of the editorial board,  the size of the article can be increased. Pages of the manuscript
      should be  numbered, starting with the first one.
          The  material should be presented in the following order:
          <ul>
            <li>UDC code (see Reference  Universal Decimal Classification) in the upper left corner</li>

            <li>Company name (no  abbreviations), city (if more than one, then the list of all relevant organisations  with footnotes
        following the names of the authors; in the case of matching jobs,  authors need to specify it)</li>
            <li>Title of the article (in  bold, centered) not more than 12 words</li>

       Symbols in figures must  strictly comply with notation of the text, and have identical spelling.
      Text in  the figures must be large enough to maintain the sharpness of the picture if  zoomed out.

            <li>the initials and last  name of each author, their position, email address, full job title (when  matching jobs, authors need to specify it once for the entire group of  authors);</li>
            <li>title of the article;</li>
            <li>article abstract of not  less than 200 words, written in good English, reflecting the main content of  the article and stating the purpose, objectives, research results and summary  of findings;</li>
