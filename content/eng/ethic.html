   <p class="main_content_title">PUBLISHING ETHICS</p>

   <p>It is necessary to agree upon standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved 
    in the act of publishing: the author, the journal editor, the peer reviewer and the publisher. 
    Our ethic statements are based on COPE's Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors.</p>

  <p class="main_content_subtitle">Publication decisions</p>
  <p>The editor of the journal is responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the 
   journal should be published. The editor may be guided by the policies of the journal's editorial board 
   and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright 
   infringement and plagiarism. The editor may confer with other editors or reviewers in making this decision.</p>

  <p class="main_content_subtitle">Fair play</p>
  <p>An editor will at any time evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content  without regard to race, 
   gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic  origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors.</p>

   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Confidentiality</p>
  <p>The editor and any editorial staff must not disclose any information about a  submitted
     manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, potential  reviewers, 
     other editorial advisers, and the publisher, as appropriate.</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Disclosure and conflicts of interest</p>
   <p>Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in  an editor's own 
     research without the express written consent of the author.</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_title">Duties of Reviewers</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Contribution to Editorial Decisions</p>
     <p>Peer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and through the  editorial
     communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the  paper.</p>
              
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Promptness</p>
    <p>Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a  manuscript or knows that its prompt 
    review will be impossible should notify the  editor and excuse himself from the review process.</p>
    
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Confidentiality</p>
   <p>Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential documents.  They must not be shown to or 
    discussed with others except as authorized by the  editor.</p>
    
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Standards of Objectivity</p>
   <p>Reviews should be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the author is  inappropriate. Referees 
   should express their views clearly with supporting  arguments.</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Acknowledgement of Sources</p>
   <p>Reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by  the authors. 
    Any statement that an observation, derivation, or argument had  been previously reported should be 
    accompanied by the relevant citation. A  reviewer should also call to the editor's attention any 
   substantial similarity  or overlap between the manuscript under consideration and any other 
  published  paper of which they have personal knowledge.</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Disclosure and Conflict of Interest</p>
   <p>Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept  confidential and not used for 
   personal advantage. Reviewers should not consider  manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting 
   from  competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of  the authors, companies, 
    or institutions connected to the papers.</p>
    
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Duties of Authors</p> </p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Reporting standards</p>
   <p>Authors of reports of original research should present an accurate account of  the work performed as well 
   as an objective discussion of its significance.  Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. 
   A paper should  contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to replicate the  work. Fraudulent or 
   knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical  behavior and are unacceptable.</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Data Access and Retention</p>
    <p>Authors are asked to provide the raw data in connection with a paper for  editorial review, 
   and should be prepared to provide public access to such data  (consistent with the ALPSP-STM Statement 
   on Data and Databases), if  practicable, and should in any event be prepared to retain such data 
   for a  reasonable time after publication.</p>

   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Originality and Plagiarism</p>
   <p>The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and  if the authors have 
   used the work and/or words of others that this has been  appropriately cited or quoted.</p>
   
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Multiple, Redundant or Concurrent Publication</p>
    <p>An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially the  same 
    research in more than one journal or primary publication. Submitting the  same manuscript to more than 
   one journal concurrently constitutes unethical  publishing behavior and is unacceptable.</p>
    
   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Acknowledgement of Sources</p>
   <p>Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors  should cite
      publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the  reported work.</p>

   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Authorship of the Paper</p>
   <p>Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution  to the
   conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All  those who have made significant 
   contributions should be listed as co-authors.  Where there are others who have participated in certain 
   substantive aspects of  the research project, they should be acknowledged or listed as contributors.  The corresponding 
   author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no  inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and 
   that all co-authors  have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its  submission for publication.</p>

   <p class="main_content_subtitle">Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest</p>
    <p>All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other  substantive conflict of interest 
   that might be construed to influence the  results or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources 
    of financial support  for the project should be disclosed.</p>

    <p class="main_content_subtitle">Fundamental errors in  published works</p>
    <p>When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own  published work, it is the author's 
    obligation to promptly notify the journal  editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to retract or correct the  paper. </p>
