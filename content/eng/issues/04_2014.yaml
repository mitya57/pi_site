     <p> The language and methods of automata-based software engineering integrated with object-oriented and predicate software engineering methods are developed. A program is constructed as a finite state automation presented in the form of control state hypergraph. Automata-based methods are illustrated on the programs of alarm clock modeling and ATM adaptation layer (type 2) protocol.

     <p> A brief description of Java-MatLab language of mathematical calculations have been done. The relationship of the language, format FB2+ and distributed network resources have been observed. The set of network solutions to create a new image of the modern technical book with pages containing executable algorithms connected to the real objects have been proposed.

     <p> Considered contamination of the group of emission sources and the action of the fence devices. Algorithm for semi-infinite optimization determines overcapacity emission sources for which standards are made pollution zones territory with flexible boundaries. Simulation results are based pollution maps to compare options for the development of local infrastructure.

   item_annot: |
     <p> The article describes the software package "Seismatica" intended for classification of seismic events. Software package is based on mathematical models of state seismic generators, which are treated as characteristic functions "waveguide" from the source to the seismic station. "Information core" of the complex is a database of seismic patterns that are presented as high-quality recordings of shock waves, confined to events with known genesis, having a certain set of characteristics.
