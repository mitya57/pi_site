     <p> The protocol-independent architecture for three axis force sensor data processing is considered. The force sensor is based on a MLX90393 triaxial magnetic sensor, capable of transmitting data via SPI protocol or I2C protocol, depending on the force sensor modification. The data generated by the MLX90393 requires additional processing before usage. To address this issue a software library is developed. Such a library shall provide means for protocol selection based on the force sensor modification. Three alternative architectural library implementations are consid­ered: the two independent program modules for both SPI and I2C protocol data transmission and processing, the two dependent program modules for SPI and I2C data transmission and one template-based module for the data processing, the two dependent program modules for SPI and I2C data transmission based on a single abstract class and the data processing module working with a pointer to the abstract class implementation. Three experimental library implementations are developed, nine experiments are performed with varying library usage setups, supplemented with one experiment with no data processing for the reference. Various criteria are considered, both quantitative and qualitative, including, but not limited to the compiled program size and the ease of library integration. The experimental results are analysed with the help of stated criteria, conclusions and practical recommendations are made.

     <p> An S-box is a non-linear transformation that takes n bits as input and returns m bits. This transformation is most easily represented as a nm lookup table. Most often, only balanced S-boxes are used in cryptography. This means that the number of input bits is equal to the number of output bits. The S-box is an important part of most symmetric ciphers. The selection of the correct substitution makes the link between the key and the ciphertext more complex (non-linear), which makes it much more difficult to hack.
     This paper deals with a hardware implementation of S-boxes. This implementation can be realized by using logical conjunction, disjunction, negation and delay blocks. The main indicator of productivity of such implementations is a circuit depth, namely the maximum length of a simple way of the circuit and a circuit complexity, namely the quantity of logic elements (negation elements are not taken into account).
     The article considers the standard synthesis methods (based on DNF, Shannon, Lupanov), proposes a new algorithm to minimize the complexity of an arbitrary Boolean functions system and a way to reduce the complexity of the circuit obtained after simplification by the ESPRESSO algorithm of DNF of the function related to the output of the S-box. To compare the efficiency of the methods, the C++ program was created that generates a circuit in the Verilog language. The estimates of depth and complexity are obtained for the schemes produced as a result of the programs operation. The article ends with a comparison of the efficiency of S-box schemes of known cryptographic standards obtained as the output of the program (with each other and with the result of the Logic Friday program).</p>

     <p> A description of the method of numerical study in the approximation of a narrow channel of the problems of flow and heat transfer in flat and circular channels of variable cross-section using a differential three-parameter model of shear turbulence is presented. The main results of numerous studies using the proposed method are described, one of the goals of which was to substantiate the possibility of using the narrow channel approximation.

     <p> Deep learning-based detectors usually produce a redundant set of object bounding boxes including many duplicate detections of the same object. These boxes are then filtered using non-maximum suppression (NMS) in order to select exactly one bounding box per object of interest. This greedy scheme is simple and provides sufficient accuracy for isolated objects but often fails in crowded environments, since one needs to both preserve boxes for different objects and suppress duplicate detections. In this work we develop an alternative iterative scheme, where a new subset of objects is detected at each iteration. Detected boxes from the previous iterations are passed to the network at the following iterations to ensure that the same object would not be detected twice. This iterative scheme can be applied to both one-stage and two-stage object detectors with just minor modifications of the training and inference proce­dures. We perform extensive experiments with two different baseline detectors on four datasets and show significant improvement over the baseline, leading to state-of-the-art performance on CrowdHuman and WiderPerson datasets.

     <p> For the construction and study of formal models of intelligent information systems, algebraic methods are useful. One of the topical directions here is the production-type logical systems, which are widespread in computer science.
     In recent years, the author and his followers have been developing the algebraic theory of LP-structures (lattice production structures). It is designed to formalize and solve a number of knowledge management problems in production systems. The method of relevant backward inference (LP-inference) was also introduced and investigated, which significantly reduces the number of calls to external information sources in comparison with classical inference. Subsequently, the theory was generalized to speed up inference in distributed production systems.
     At the same time, modern intelligent systems are characterized by fuzzy knowledge and fuzzy reasoning. There­fore, there is a need to extend the theory of LP-structures to fuzzy production systems. This research was initiated in previous articles by the author. Some concepts are introduced that impart fuzziness to LP-structures, and certain properties of fuzzy LP-inference are established. In recent works, research results are presented that systematically generalize the theory of LP-structures to the case of fuzzy knowledge bases. The terminology of FLP-structures with fuzzy logical relation (Fuzzy LP-structures) is introduced, the main standard properties are proved.
     The present work complements the FLP-structure model by investigating a class of production-logical equations. Relevant inference ideas are based on it, reducing the number of calls to external sources of information. Methods for solving these equations are formulated. For the first time, questions about the existence and number of solutions have been resolved. Finding a solution to a production-logical equation corresponds to the backward fuzzy inference in a production system. The proved theorems can be used for software implementation of fuzzy LP-structures and corresponding optimization of fuzzy inference. Some ideas for this implementation are discussed. </p>

     <p> In this paper, a number of issues related to the use of word embeddings for solving the problem of classifying text documents were considered. Models of word embeddings have been a popular object of theoretical research since the mid-1970. The development of these models, including the transition from count based models to predictive ones, was stimulated by the need to reduce the large computational costs arising from their practical use. This problem is still relevant today. When solving practical problems, one often has to abandon the independent construction of word embeddings and use ready-made solutions. As a result, the problem of post-processing of the existing word embeddings, for example, reducing its dimension, becomes urgent.
     Recently, a number of works have appeared in which an unusual approach to using the principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of word embeddings has been investigated. In this approach, projections are removed not on the last, but on the first principal components. It turns out that in relation to the problems of determining the word similarity and word analogies, this approach can increase the accuracy of their solution. Experimental studies, the results of which are presented in this work, show that this effect is not observed in solving the problem of document classification. Removing projections to the first directions leads to a decrease in the classification accuracy. At the same time, the traditional approach, which removes projections to the last principal directions, in most cases gives the best result. </p>
