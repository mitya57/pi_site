     <p> The paper presents the results of adaptation of existing algorithms of neutron-physical processes in the nuclear reactor simulation and their implementations to supercomputers environment. An analysis was made of current simulation algorithm implementation in order to identify its most resource-intensive parts. The individual software components of the model and their relationships have been investigated to identify opportunities for parallelization. The parallel version of the simulation algorithms was developed and implemented. Implemented algorithms have been tested and their algorithmic efficiency was investigated.

   item_authors_address: '<b> L. Yu. Barash</b>, <b> L. N. Shchur </b>,  e-mail: shchur@chg.ru'
   item_annot: |
     <p> We report approach for the generation of parallel un-correlated streams of pseudorandom numbers. We apply our method to the number of modern and reliable pseudorandom number generators and develop particular algorithms for initialization of parallel streams. Particularly, each of our GPGPU realizations can produce exactly the same output sequence as the original algorithm.

     <p> Because of development of the society, information and educational technologies, the timetabling problem becomes more and more complicated not only in its algo-rithmics but in description of used data. The authors attempt to systemize their gathered experience in this do-main and to propose a data modeling language for universities timetabling problem.

   item_name: LP Structures Reduction for Automation of Refactoring in Object-Oriented Systems
   item_authors_address: '<b> M. D. Shurlin</b>, e-mail: mshurlin@gmail.com'
   item_annot: |
     <p> In the information system industry an important direction is connected with the development of formal models for programming objects. Such models provide a basis for automated verification and optimization of the program code. In this paper a class of lattice-based algebraic structures describing semantics of a type hierarchy in an object-oriented system is considered. The properties of such structures, including existence of logical reduction are studied. The methodology is designed to verify and upgrade type hierarchies and is focused on elimination of code redundancy. Proofs of the results obtained are given for the first time.
