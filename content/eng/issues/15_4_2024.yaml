     <p> The results of an experimental comparison of programs for technologically independent minimization of complexity of multilevel representations of systems of fully defined functions based on the Shannon expansion are described. The main attention is paid to the effectiveness of using, when synthesizing logical circuits, a program that implements an algorithm for solving the problem of extracting from a system of functions such subsystems for which it is advisable to carry out joint minimization of multi-level representations of subsystems in the form of Binary Decision Diagrams, called BDD-representations, and in the form of Boolean net. The complexity of the representation is estimated by the total number of literals of Boolean variables in a set of interrelated logical equations that define a system of Boolean functions. After extracting the subsystems and their joint minimization, the synthesis of logic circuits is carried out in the design library of custom digital CMOS VLSIs, the results are compared in terms of chip area and speed (time delay) on a stream of 39 industrial examples of circuits. It was found that for 20 examples, the subsystem selection algorithm allows one to obtain better solutions than joint or separate minimization of multi-level representations based on Shannon expansion (13 examples). The three best solutions are obtained by applying the well-known Espresso program for minimizing functions in the DNF class, and the three solutions are obtained by the synthesizer using the original (non-optimized) matrix representations of DNF systems of Boolean functions.

     <p> The article is devoted to the study of the mechanisms of interaction between the popular programming languages Java and JavaScript using a retrospective approach. The author consistently examines the development of tools of this kind, starting from LiveConnect technology and Java applets of the mid-1990s and ending with the interpreters of the last decade. Particular attention is paid to comparing the performance of the currently relevant tools Nashorn and Graal.js. The latter is an implementation of the JavaScript language based on the Truffle framework and Context API, which is a Polyglot context for executing all supported guest languages with the Graal JIT compiler, ensuring their optimal performance. The author gives a definition to the term "warm-up", which is recommended by the GraalVM developers to achieve the highest performance. This is a kind of pre-compilation mode, the process of repeated preliminary execution of JavaScript code by the interpreter before its actual usage in order to obtain information about the most frequently utilized fragments of the program, its functions, types and data structures, alongside with their subsequent caching and optimization. The results of testing based on a project from Oracle and the authors application made it possible to verify the results declared by the GraalVM developers and can be used to optimize and improve the performance of multilingual projects using a unified technology stack, as well as when migrating the server code base from Java to JavaScript.</p>

     <p> In order to improve the existing step-by-step principle of determining the limits of the range of cardiorespiratory synchronization (CRS) and the regulatory and adaptive capabilities of the human body, a regression analysis of measurements of the CRS parameters system was carried out. Statistical prediction of the minimum limit of the synchronization range in the CRS method was performed using linear, nonlinear multiple regression models, as well as neural network regression. The following parameters were used as the basis for predicting the minimum limit of the synchronization range: initial heart rate, initial respiratory rate, age and gender. The variable initial heart rate contributed the most to all regression models. A comparative analysis of the quality indicators of all models showed that the prediction of the minimum limit of the synchronization range can be carried out both by linear multiple regression and using neural network regression implemented by means of a 3-4-1 multilayer perceptrons. However, having already had a NN-regression forecast of maximum limit of the synchronization range, as well as a NN-classification of the level of regulatory-adaptive status, the use of NN-regression will be proposed as the main forecasting method for its implementation in the software of the CRS measurement system.</p>

     <p> The paper proposes a method for determining the dynamics of aspectual content of scientific texts. The problems arising in the automatic processing of scientific texts are discussed, approaches to the creation of a combined method of aspect-oriented analysis of scientific texts are proposed. The results of experiments of aspect analysis of scientific publications in the field of mathematics are given.
     The algorithm of aspect analysis is built on the basis of processing both the semantic domain graph formed as a result of automatic extraction of information from the text of the mathematical encyclopedia and the weighted semantic graph of the publication. Weighting functions for calculating the dependence of links between professional terms of the semantic domain graph are proposed. During the processing the text of a scientific publication, the semantic domain graph is transformed into the semantic graph of the publication, the two-phase processing algorithm of which forms semantic dependencies between text fragments.</p>
