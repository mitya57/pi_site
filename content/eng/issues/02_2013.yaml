   item_annot: |
     <p> A feature that hasn't yet received a full-fledged implementation from any component-based software development technology is examined. The feature consists in being able to create new data types (components) at runtime. An object-oriented architecture of a model providing this capability is presented.

     <p> The architecture of the testbed Nest is proposed and its subsystems are presented. The Nest base on the enterprise architecture object model. The object graph of a concrete enterprise is stored in the database. The approach provides access to the different measurement data, made in the realistic workload conditions and structured by hardware, organizational and spatial units of the enterprise and by them arbitrary aggregations.
