     <p> The interrelation of methods and the means used in computer science and economies is considered, at creation of custom-made software products for difficult systems. Methods of estimation of quantity of the information and information complexity of software products in systems are offered. Ways of an estimation and comparison of economic characteristics of intellectual work, complexity of design and manufacture of software products are presented

   item_name: Computation Anomalies Detection in Implementations of Algorithms
   item_authors_address: ' <b> D. A. Orlov </b>, e-mail: orlovdmal@gmail.com'
   item_annot: |
     <p> In the majority of program implementations of algorithms, real numbers are substituted with floating-point numbers. In most cases the result obtained is near to exact result, and good enough for practical purposes. However, in some cases one can obtain result qualitatively different from the exact result. Such situations are called computation anomalies.
     </p><p>In this paper the definition of computation anomaly is given, the mechanism of occurrence of computation anomalies is discussed. The methods of finding cases where computation anomaly can occur and algorithm implementation testing are proposed.

   item_annot: |
     <p> In this paper we consider traditional approaches to enforcing information security in distributed computing environments based on Grid and Cloud computing technologies. The trust asymmetry issue is emphasized, and several techniques of ensuring mutual trust between producers and consumers of computing services are discussed.
