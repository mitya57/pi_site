   item_name: LP-Structures for Justification and Automation of Refactoring in Object-Oriented Programming
   item_annot: |
     <p>In the software industry an important direction is connected with the development of formal models for automated objects. Such models provide a basis for effective verification and optimization of the program code. In this paper a class of lattice-based algebraic structures describing semantics of a type hierarchy in an object-oriented system is considered. The properties of such structures, including closedness, equivalent transformations, and existence of logical reduction are studied. The methodology is designed to verify and upgrade type hierarchies and is focused on automatic elimination of code redundancy. As a result of the generalized theoretical model a new refractoring method of attribute joining is obtained and formalized.</p>
     <p>Implementation issues are briefly discusses.</p>
   item_keywords: type hierarchy, refactoring, algebraic model, common attributes, implementation.

   item_name: A Software Suite for Performing Science Intensive Computational Experiments Based on Vortex Methods for Numerical Modeling of Non-Stationary Hydrodynamic Processes
   item_annot: |
     <p>Issues related to construction of effective software suite built with the use of elements of software engineering for performing computational experiments based on vortex methods for numerical modeling of non-stationary hydrodynamic processes are considered. The results of the main stages of the development process of the software suite are presented. These stages include: formalization and systematization of the requirements, software architecture development, detailed design, development of effective algorithms, coding and testing. The results of the testing process prove that the characteristics of the software suite conform to the requirements formulated.</p>

   item_name: Evolutional Approach in Programming Training
   item_annot: |
     <p>A modern Integrated development environment (IDE) provides programmers with more facilities than their predecessors had. Presence of these facilities offers even beginner programmers an opportunity of using leading development methods. This work deals with how to use these opportunities on the first stages of learning programming.</p>
