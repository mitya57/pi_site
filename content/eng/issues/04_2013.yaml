     <p> Consider a collection of documents with expert thematic model. To verify the adequacy of the expert model build an algorithmic model by hierarchical clustering text collections. The agglomerative and divisive clustering methods are investigated. The algorithmic model error in comparison to the expert model is estimated. The differences between expert model and algorithmic model are visualized.

     <p> In work the estimation of an error of a unknown vector received at modeling of physical processes and technical constructions by Poisson's equations is offered. As a rule, the solution of the partial differential equations is obtained after the discretization by systems of linear algebraic equations (SLAE) with rarefied matrixes. The analysis of sensitivity of system is based on an aprioristic estimation of its reaction to influence of the entrance data expressed in intervals, corresponding to errors of boundary conditions and source function. The offered technique of an estimation of an error of the solution can help to reveal nodes of a real construction or a power field which are the most vulnerable at occurrence of extreme deviations. The received estimations guarantee reliability of calculations necessary for prevention of dangerous situations at practical realization of models of thermal and electromagnetic processes, stationary problems of building mechanics and for many other physical and technical problems.

     <p> The article describes the algorithm of the predesign researches and modeling of information systems. The implementation of the algorithm is required to solve the relevant scientific problem of increasing the effectiveness of pre-work for development of information and technical systems. The list of basic procedures is required for the pre-work for the stage of conceptual design of information systems. This method will improve the efficiency of modeling process, and pre-work for creation of information systems through the implementation of a systematic approach for analyzing and synthesizing it.
