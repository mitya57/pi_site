     <p> The article considers the problem of automatic scripts and files generation based on the data and templates stored in the database. This problem is typical for information systems using SQL servers for data storing. The authors introduce the original representations of template files and file structure for relational databases and the method of scripts generation on the basis of these representations. The article also describes two examples of scripts generation.

     <p> The article offers an algorithm of text processing in order to prepare it for the syntactic analysis. The algorithm identifies the lexical units of text and other tokens, presents them in a form suitable for further processing by the syntactic component of the linguistic processor A module of declarative morphological analysis of English words is developed.
