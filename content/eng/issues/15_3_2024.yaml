     <p>  Software tools for compiling and decompiling descriptions of transistor circuits are widely used in computer-aided VLSI design. These two operations are inverse to each other in terms of guiding the design process. Netlist compiling a hierarchical schematics allows its specification to be converted into a functionally equivalent flat netlist. The goal of the decompilation is to reconstruct the hierarchical description of the circuit by extracting subcircuits that are gates or more complex elements.
     This paper examines the problem of compiling hierarchical MOS transistor circuits. The initial hierarchical schematic and resulting flat netlist are specified in SPICE format. A fast recursive algorithm for compilation of hierarchical descriptions of arbitrary nesting depth and its software implementation in C++ are proposed. During the compilation process, the ports of the circuit substituted in place of the component being compiled are renamed, as well as the names of internal nets and elements in the description of the circuit itself by adding a prefix to them that specifies the path in the hierarchy to the component being compiled.
     The developed compilation program was tested on a number of practical hierarchical transistor circuits as part of a transistor circuit analyzer for functional equivalence. The results of the compilation program tests make it possible to evaluate the increase in compilation time with increasing complexity of circuits and the depth of subcircuits nesting, as well as to compare the performance of the compilation procedure and its inverse procedure of decompiling the resulting flat netlist. </p>

     <p> The paper presents the models and algorithms for searching, filtering and ranking data in an information analysis system, based on the ontological description of its structure. The rules for filtering and ranking objects based on their boolean, numeric or enumerable properties are specified by the users, and based on these rules SQL queries are evaluated. Another problem considered is taking subject area into account when searching for objects. Adding this allows one to solve many tasks that occur in current research information systems, such as searching for experts in given subject areas or generating reports. A search query can be specified in the form of a set of keywords, and a statistical approach is used for comparing keyword sets.

     <p> One of the most important tasks in tourism is helping tourists plan a trip to a given place. Since it is impossible to visit all places, tourists try to be rational and choose what they find most acceptable and attractive. Each plan has limitations (e. g., length of tour, limited budget) and preferences (e. g., art, culture, historical sites, architecture, modernism) that should be considered when planning your travel trip. This is a special case of the Orientation problem — Tourist trip design problem. The goal is to maximize the total score achieved within a given tour duration limit. This paper focuses on developing a recommendation system that considers users limitations during tour planning and their preferences. Since this problem is an NP-hard problem, heuristic algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA) are well suited for solving it. However, this algorithm can take a very long time to find the optimal solution, so this article focuses on developing a greedy strategy of GA to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. Instead of random genetic transformations, the algorithm consciously modifies optimal routes in order to find the desired tour for the users in a shorter time. After this, the developed algorithm was compared with a GA using various generated user profiles. Over 700 locations in Novosibirsk were used as a dataset for making recommendations. These modifications made it possible to obtain optimal routes faster than the standard implementation of the genetic algorithm.</p>

     <p> This article describes an algorithm for the automatic selection of hydropneumatic capacitive vessels used for household and industrial purposes. The suggested informational system makes it possible to reduce the working time spent on the selection of equipment and increase the relevance of the analyzed information. The article discusses a detailed description of the design of pneumohydroaccumulators, as well as provides examples of calculations of their main characteristics. The main task we needed to solve was a multi-criteria choice, and the article provides an overview of methods for solving this problem. In addition to these methods, we analyzed information systems that allow one to select suitable equipment among various alternatives. Based on the analysis of methods and similar software solutions, the authors suggested an information system and an algorithm for automatic selection of hydraulic accumulators by searching for options that meet the parameters specified by the system user.
     Also, the article discusses the process of purchasing capacitive equipment. There was demonstrated a logical model of the database structure storing the technical characteristics of the equipment which reflects objects of the information system and their connections. In this article we presented and argued the software for development of a specified information system. The development of the information system was based on the "1С platform: The enterprise". The task of selecting hydropneumatic capacitive vessels was solved by a request that can be interacted with through a report in the information system. This report allows the user to search for equipment by quantitative and qualitative characteristics: volume, operating pressure, vessel material, flange material, installation type (vertical or horizontal), availability of legs, cost, manufacturer or supplier. The report options allow users to search for equipment both in accordance with the specified parameters and with a deviation from them but only if the parameter is quantitative. The results of the report are ordered by relevance to the criteria specified by the user. The operation of the report query aggregating data was reflected in the flowchart. The article presents a situation where the user solves the selection problem by using capabilities of the report. The problem of multi-criteria selection was formulated in a way to demonstrate how a clear parameter of the report becomes fuzzy, and our solution of it allows you to find more alternative options with sorting by relevance helping you to identify the most suitable pneumohydroaccumulator. This software package was registered in the state registry of computer programs.</p>

     <p> The article describes the purpose, scope, main parameters of the flowchart of the procedure used to calculate control devices when comparing vehicle suspension structures with a 6x6 wheel arrangement. Methods for comparing suspensions during maneuvers are described. A description of the cab suspension system, a block diagram of the simulation program is presented. The visualization of the process of rebuilding the studied model of a 6*6 vehicle with two different types of front suspension is shown. An estimate of the load on the front and rear axles during the rebuilding for a period of time t = 5 s, their energy output and inertia is given. The distribution of the load along the axes of the investigated 6*6 vehicle model is presented when rebuilding with the front suspension of the first and second types. The coordinates of the base points of the front axle allow you to evaluate the numerical values for specific coordinates at a given point in time.</p>
