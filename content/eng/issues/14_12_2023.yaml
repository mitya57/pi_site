     <p>  The problem of constructing a HIL simulation stand for researching a technological process using programmable logic controller (PLC) "Baget" is described in this article.
     Issues of modeling technological processes are currently extremely relevant, since modeling is a mandatory stage in the automated process control systems development. An adequate model of the technological process allows debugging and verification of automated process control system algorithms without using real equipment, reducing financial costs and the probability of emergency situations.
     The HIL modeling method involves partial use of real equipment as part of the model. The inclusion of standard components of the original object in the model does not require detailed mathematical model and at the same time provides a more complete correspondence to the original. Due to using a computer from the original object, the stand software operates under conditions close to the real technological process, which improves the quality of the simulation results.
     The HIL modeling stand includes the following components:
     <ol>
     <li>control computer of automated process control system;</li>
     <li>programmable logic controller PLC "Baget";</li>
     <li>simulation computer.</li>
     </ol>
     The stand for the basic element of an automated process control system allows to speed up the process of prototyping and debugging even in the case of complex systems, because it will be easier to build the entire system from correctly functioning elements.
     Another advantage of this approach is that the stand is not tied to a specific type of technological process or to a narrow area of production — the stand allows the use of ready-made models, the development of new models, and the inclusion of various function libraries.
     The simplicity of the stand design with this approach is combined with a full range of functionality. By connecting additional software, you can create more complicated and detaild model. This stand is also capable of serving both for debugging PLC algorithms and as a simulator for maintenance personnel of a real control object, because the stand operator can simulate failures and errors of standard equipment, emergency situations at the control object.
     Using C and JavaScript programming languages for development ensures portability and ease of expanding the capabilities of the modeling software.
     The development of complex systems based on HIL modeling allows saving resources and effectively solving assigned problems, therefore the proposed approach to building stands will be in demand in the process of developing an automated process control system based on the PLC "Baget".</p>

     <p> The article discusses the mechanism for updating the built-in software (firmware) in distributions of the Linux operating system (OS). Considering the import "substitution strategy" in Russia proposed in technology sector and the active transition to this OS, including in solutions related to the digitalization of the energy sector, the problem of additional control over the firmware update process, incl. in used domestic distributions (AstraLinux, AltLinux). At the moment most popular mechanism of automatic firmware update is Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS), article includes brief description of its update process. Using software developed for complete monitoring LVFS metadata were found multiply inconsistencies of current scheme of firmware update — deleting of files from index, replacement of already uploaded images with same id. Also basing on client agent metadata it is possible to organize targeted substitution of binary images transferred by service directly to hardware bypassing built-in monitoring tools. Finally it is concluded that there are potential vulnerabilities in this mechanism and a solution is proposed in the form of organizing own service with additional layer for verification of "firmware" during process of its distribution. If scheme with additional security layer over base of popular and well proved by practice LVFS will be successful it can be used in industrial applications with including in future in appropriate standards as reference model.</p>

The use of IES digital twins makes it possible to effectively simulate various directions of their development in the virtual space, which ensures the creation of effective design solutions.
     The article is devoted to the construction of digital twins for the design of lESs. A new methodological approach to the design of an IES based on its digital twin, developed by the authors, is presented, which includes the following components: the architecture of the software platform for creating digital twins; a set of technologies and tools for its implementation; methods for automated construction of a computing subsystem of a digital twin; methodology for the design of IES based on its digital twin. The results of a computational experiment obtained using the completed software implementation of the elements of an IES digital twin are presented.

     <p> Corporate human capital is one of the most important drivers of sustainable economic growth that is becoming increasingly important under changing nature of work. Due to the expansion of various areas of human activity, an employee portrait is getting multifaceted. Therefore, the problem of human capital management based on the individual trajectories of professional development, aimed at increasing the labor efficiency and contributing to the growth of he corporate operational efficiency, is relevant, timely, socially and economically significant.
     The paper proposes an approach for the dynamic regimes for human capital development (DRHC), to design individual trajectories for the employees professional development, based on reinforcement learning methods. The DRHC develops an optimal management regime as a set of programs aimed at developing an employee in the professional field, taking into account their individual characteristics (health quality, major and interdisciplinary competencies, motivation and social capital).
     The DRHC architecture consists of an environment — an employee model as a Markov decision making process and an agent — decision making center of a company. The DRHC uses Double Deep Q-Network algorithms to maximize the agents utility function. The implementation of the proposed by DRHC policies would enhance the corporate HC quality, improve its resource efficiency and ensure the performance growth.</p>

     <p> Content management system NetCat 6 provides the development of adaptive websites with CSS3 layout for desktops and mobile devices. Websites are created in no-code mode based on ready-made components; a programming developer is provided with an API for creating components with new functionality.
     The possibilities provided by NetCat 6 are discussed on the example of a catalog of reconstructed houses with a geoinformation function. The development method consists in creating an interactive prototype of the site by a designer, with subsequent refinement of its automatically generated codes by a programmer. The site was created within the waterfall model of software development that turns project management to an unimprovable simplicity.
     The practical significance of the work lies in the application of the most predictable software development model in terms of time and cost to create a site with non-standard functionality and adaptive design. An improvement of the NetCat toolkit is proposed to increase the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p>
