     <p>Data of micro-electromechanical systems (sensors) are widely used in modern multipurpose intellectual environments, autonomous mobile robots and automated systems possessing intellectual components. Since the amount of data delivered by the sensors is rather considerable and their significance varies we propose a fuzzy method of the data preliminary classification aimed at selection of the data important for the planning and control decisions while meaningless data or data that do not contain new information are discarded. As a result the amount of the resource intensive intellectual processing and the workload in the network infrastructure could be reduced significantly. The paper presents the analysis for the preliminary classification problem, the abstract model of a sensor and classification method. The method is based on the delay which is controlled by multiplicative decrease additive increase rule and expresses the expectation of the context uncertainty. The delay decreases if the variables measured by the sensor presumably change and increases if it keep its value. Numerical examples are presented as well. They consider the set of mount chest accelerometer uncalibrated measurements. We compare source data set and set of the selected values formed by an algorithm implementing fuzzy preliminary classification. Several metrics were used to compare the selected values with the source data and with CMA filter as well.</p>

     <p>This study investigates the dynamics of air pollution caused by particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in Omsk, Russia. Data collected from the Sensor.Community network between 2021 and 2023 were analyzed using time series analysis methods. The findings reveal a subtle weekly seasonality in the data, potentially attributed to fluctuations in industrial activity and traffic patterns throughout the week. Additionally, a concerning trend of deteriorating air quality was identified, characterized by increasing annual average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5.
     The study employed various time series analysis techniques, including Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF), Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), and autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis.
     These methods allowed for the visualization and examination of data distribution, trend identification, and seasonality detection. Furthermore, the Mann-Kendall test confirmed a statistically significant trend of increasing pollution levels over the three-year period.
     To enhance the accuracy of spatial analysis, data interpolation was performed using kriging with a Gaussian model. This method, compared to simple interpolation, provides a more precise assessment of the spatial distribution of pollutants. The study also implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for forecasting hourly pollution values. LSTM exhibited promising results, demonstrating its potential for developing early warning systems, particularly when combined with meteorological data such as wind forecasts.
     The results highlight the need for effective measures to mitigate air pollution in Omsk and emphasize the importance of utilizing data from diverse sources, including official air quality monitoring stations, to ensure accuracy and reliability in air quality assessments.</p>

     <p>Reducing the time and cost of developing application information systems by increasing the efficiency of the work performed is one of the main priorities of their modern production. With the development of AI technologies in all areas of activity, including medicine, there is a need for continuous improvement of both the client and server parts of information systems for many different nosologies. The purpose of this study is to form a ready-made library of components for the template design of user interfaces in the field of thyroidology (a field of medicine aimed at diagnosing and treating thyroid diseases) based on the experience gained in the development of several medical information systems for identifying thyroid diseases. Ensuring a conveyor mechanism for developing interfaces for medical information systems is possible only with specialized components of the tool based on a detailed understanding of the specifics of the actions of an endocrinologist. The components of the developed library cover up to 60 % of the component base of the interface of thyroidological systems, and are divided into several parts: for manipulating medical images and texts, annotating, creating input forms, working with tables of medical values, etc. The developed component library has been tested in the creation of intelligent information systems for the work of doctors of ultrasound and cytological diagnostics of thyroid diseases.</p>

     <p>The article discusses the problem of determining the nature of an obstacle using a force sensor for terrain mapping. Three classes of objects have been introduced: the first class is "static" obstacles, the second class is "moving" obstacles, the third class is "unstable" obstacles. To conduct experiments, a simulation system was built in the Gazebo modeling environment, including a manipulator with the ability to horizontally move a probe with a force sensor and a set of obstacles corresponding to three classes of obstacles. All experiments were carried out using the ROS framework, the Gazebo simulator and the Movelt manipulation software. Processing of signals from the force sensor showed that the sig­nals for the three classes of obstacles are different, which makes it possible to identify the class based on sensor readings. Based on the analysis of data received from the sensor, rules were formed that make it possible to determine the class of an obstacle during its interaction with the manipulator in real time. To determine the obstacle class, the values of the force sensor signals are considered, smoothed by the moving average method. According to the rules discussed in the article, an algorithm was developed to determine the class of obstacle, which was implemented in the Gazebo modeling environment. Testing of the algorithm showed the stability of its operation under the given experimental conditions. Successful determination of the obstacle class will allow one not only to construct a map of the area, but also to prevent damage to the device when exposed to a "static" object with excessive force. The presented approach can be expanded to narrower classes of obstacles that characterize objects that can be encountered by a mobile device when mapping a forest area.</p>

     <p>The article discusses technologies for developing the web application designed to accompany the process of conducting an intellectual game in the format of an interactive quiz. An analysis of similar applications was carried out, which showed that none of them satisfies all the criteria essential in this situation. Requirements for the web application have been determined: the ability to create a library of quizzes, various types of questions, edit ready-made quizzes, participants enter answers through their devices online, award points for the correctness and speed of answers, display questions on the presenter's screen and on team devices, view intermediate and final results in the form of a list, returning participants to the game if necessary, saving the points received. The process of developing an optimized user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which allows users to interact with the web application, is described, the structure of the web application, the main forms of the administrator and game participants are presented. The server side of the application was developed using Node.JS technologies, including the Socket.io library, and the MongoDB database, the resulting collection of non-relational database is shown. To implement the functionality of the application pages, JavaScript was used; examples of codes are presented that implement the mechanism for connecting the presenter to the game, retrieving information from the database, recording the team's response, and awarding points for the correctness and speed of the response.
     The web application allows you to reduce the time spent by event organizers and participants and makes it possible to improve the organization of work in general.
     The presented web application for accompanying intellectual games was successfully approbated during events at the Nizhny Tagil State Social-Pedagogical Institute (branch) of the Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University. The materials of the article can serve as practical recommendations for the development of such web applications to accompany intellectual games held in the format of interactive quizzes.</p>
