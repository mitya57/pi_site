     <p> The development of software engineering is a very fast process. Already long-growing trends in the transition to "flexible" and "lightweight" software development paradigms are joined by new technologies of version control management and methods of continuous integration and delivery of software releases. New forms of organizing development teams, including geographically distributed teams, work outside of offices, and mobile planning and communications tools, are gaining significant importance. This article summarizes some results of two author studies of 2017 and 2019 about the reflection of modern world practices in software engineering and software quality management in Russian IT companies. About 150 engineers, analysts, project managers from all federal districts of the Russian Federation took part in the researches. The article presents the corresponding analysis and conclusions about the dynamics of the main processes and the similarities of technological and organizational shifts in Russian software engineering in comparison with global trends.

     <p> The device of the research of mechatronic complex for detection, fixation, storage of mobile objects, its structure and the principle of action are presented in the article. The main components of the mechatronic complex are: pneumatic actuators controlled by Siemens S7-1200 programmable logic controller; the system for detecting moving objects and controlling the movement of actuators in real time, consisting of magnetic position sensors and an optical sensor.
     There are problems in the automatic control mode of the mechatronic complex. It is necessary to determine the balance between minimum time for combining the axes of a moving object and pneumatic actuators and delay time for implementing a command to fix a moving object. These process variables are controlled by system delay timers. Thus, the technological operation of fixing a moving object is the most complicated operation in the mechatronic complex for programming.
     The authors have developed mathematical methods and software to solve problems of combining the axes, allowing to synchronize technological operations in two modes. The kinematic model of the mechatronic complex, which allows to determine delay time for fixing a moving object, is presented. The sequence of movements of the actuator mechanisms, depending on the signal states of the optical and magnetic position sensors, is depicted as a cyclogram and implemented in the language of relay-contact circuits. Usage of system timers in the structure of the software code, which ensure the combination of axes of pneumatic capture and the moving object, is the main feature of the mechatronic complex. Experimental results show an improvement in reliability and speed when mechatronic complex works in the automatic control mode.</p>

     <p> This paper addresses the problem of scale estimation in monocular SLAM by estimating absolute distances between camera centers of consecutive image frames. These estimates would improve the overall performance of classical (not deep) SLAM systems and allow metric feature locations to be recovered from a single monocular camera. We propose several network architectures that lead to an improvement of scale estimation accuracy over the state of the art. In addition, we exploit a possibility to train the neural network only with synthetic data derived from a computer graphics simulator. Our key insight is that, using only synthetic training inputs, we can achieve similar scale estimation accuracy as that obtained from real data. This fact indicates that fully annotated simulated data is a viable alternative to existing deep-learning-based SLAM systems trained on real (unlabeled) data. Our experiments with unsupervised domain adaptation also show that the difference in visual appearance between simulated and real data does not affect scale estimation results. Our method operates with low-resolution images (0.03MP), which makes it practical for real-time SLAM applications with a monocular camera.</p>

     <p> This article highlights aspects of designing a software module that provides the ability to adjust the geometry of computational meshes by realizing their motion and topological changes as part of numerical experiments in the field of continuum mechanics using the OpenFOAM platform. This type of modification of the mesh model is carried out as part of the preprocessing of a numerical experiment using the moveDynamicMesh utility and allows you to take into account a larger number of parameters of a real object or process in the numerical model. The module is integrated into the basic version of the graphical shell for working with the OpenFOAM platform, thereby expanding the capabilities of the graphical shell and making it effective for solving a larger list of problems in continuum mechanics. The relevance of the study is determined, the shortcomings of existing solutions are identified. A description of the moveDynamicMesh utility, the features of the formation of the corresponding dictionary file, and a list of its possible parameters that determine the characteristics of the numerical model are given. At the beginning of the article, the goal of the study and the set of tasks necessary for its achievement are formulated. The diagrams of the structure and logic of the module, as well as descriptions of the diagrams are given. A stack of technologies is presented, on the basis of which a module is implemented, including the language for implementing the logic of its operation and a framework for designing a graphic component. The results of module tests are presented on the example of one of the standard tasks of continuum mechanics included in the OpenFOAM distribution. The final conclusions, novelty and practical value of the study are formulated. The source code of the module is hosted on the hosting service of GitHub IT projects, the corresponding link is provided.</p>

     <p> The basics of the organization and operation of the background program PdbCron, designed to perform periodic scheduled data processing in the PostgreSQL DBMS (cleaning temporary or outdated data, checking the correct­ness or backup data) on its own schedule in automatic mode in the operating environment of Linux are considered. The approach is entirely founded on free distributed Postgres software (including libpq function library and utility pgdump). Likewise a well-known program Cron the program PdbCron is a permanently active "daemon" in Linux environment, but is entirely focused on databases processing instead of tasks scheduling in the system. Unlike the Cron, the program uses different formats of schedule items based not only on the month format (year — month — day — hour — minute), but on the week format (year — week — day — hour — minute) or short year format (year— day of year — hour — minute). The number of a week in the year is determined according to ISO 8601 standard. Every schedule item can be associated with an arbitrary list of processing steps applied to arbitrary subset of databases on a Postgres server (including an SQL-statement execution, a stored function call or dump generation). The structure of PdbCron and the functions of its main components are described. Although the program was intended for use in a very specific project, its authors tried to develop it so that the features of this project in no way affect its properties and capabilities. Maximum versatility and the capability of reuse were considered among the main priorities.
