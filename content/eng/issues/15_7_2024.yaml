     <p>The paper presents original methods and approaches for integrating, from the user's point of view, three-dimensional virtual models visible to them in a virtual reality headset, and their physical prototypes. This allows for the addition of some important elements of physical reality to the virtual environment, such as tactile and muscle-motor sensations. Developed solutions are based on the use of such wireless devices as HTC Vive Trackers, which determine their position and orientation in space, and can be placed on various objects of the real world. An original approach to making a tracking system by means of two HTC Base Stations and several Vive Trackers with selecting one anchor element is proposed, as well as new methods for real-time integration of physical reality objects with their virtual models by using functional control schemes with own blocks for trackers. Based on methods and approaches proposed in this work, software modules were implemented. Approbation of these modules in the VirSim virtual environment system, which was developed in Scientific Research Institute for System Analysis of the Russian Academy of Sciences, showed that the solutions developed are adequate and effective, and can have practical application in virtual environment systems and training complexes.</p>

     <p>The paper proposes a new method and algorithm for creating a photo map of the seabed from photographs obtained from on-board photo and video systems of autonomous uninhabited underwater vehicles during fulfillment of their various missions. This photo map is formed from photographs of the seabed by sequentially overlapping them. At the same time, data on the position of the underwater vehicle received from the on-board navigation system at the time of receipt of each photograph is used to position each photo image on the generated photo map. And to rotate and scale these photographic images, data on the orientation of the underwater vehicle in the global coordinate system and its height above the bottom, also obtained from the on-board navigation system, are used. To provide quick access to the photo map, it is proposed to store it on an on-board data storage device in the form of a tile map, widely used when creating interactive geographical maps, for example, Google Maps. However, the formation of a tile map is usually carried out on the basis of all the already received photographic images, as is done with satellite images, which cannot be applied on board underwater vehicles when data from the photo-video system is received sequentially. Therefore, a special algorithm has been developed and implemented that generates a tile map during the movement of the underwater vehicle and updates only the area of the tile map in which the photo is currently being taken. This minimizes the computational load and ensures the formation of a photo map of the bottom using standard on-board computing devices. The conducted semi-natural experiments with data obtained as a result of performing real missions using the MMT-3000 underwater vehicle confirmed the high efficiency of using the developed method and algorithm.</p>

     <p>A brief overview of the results of recent research published in open sources in the field of route planning and navigation algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is presented. Works devoted to global and local planning of trajectories taking into account known and detected obstacles in flight, as well as issues of navigation of groups of drones, are considered. Various approaches are analyzed, including graph algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees), methods of data mining in real time, potential fields. Special attention is paid to work on the use of neural networks and machine learning, SLAM and multi-agent technologies for planning UAV routes. The advantages and disadvantages of the main groups of algorithms are considered. A conclusion is drawn about the prospects for using hybrid methods, as well as machine learning technologies, to build intelligent UAV traffic control systems.</p>

     <p>The article presents the results of developing a software system for production planning in the field of wood harvesting. The objects of research are the planning of harvesting operations, forest transport, construction, repair and maintenance of forest roads, as well as solving various related problems. The purpose of the work is to develop a native specialized software system for production planning in the field of wood harvesting, which is integrated with existing accounting and monitoring systems and is based on solving complex optimization problems of large dimensions using original specially developed methods and algorithms that take into account all the features of wood harvesting production in the Russian Federation. As a result of this work, an approach to creating such а system was developed, which includes a set of requirements for the software product, as well as formulations of the main tasks to be solved, listing the necessary initial data and information obtained as an output. The proposed approach was implemented by Russian IT-company Opti-Soft in the form of software product Opti-Wood — a multipurpose Decision Support System (DSS) designed for the use at forestry enterprises as a tool for optimizing production planning, management and control. The Opti-Wood system was developed in close contact with a large wood harvesting enterprise in the Republic of Karelia. The system is based on original algorithms for solving several optimization problems of increased complexity. Using the system allows one to increase the efficiency of logging processes by reducing costs in supply chains, the volume of warehouse stocks, the number of required vehicles; by mutual agreement of plans for harvesting operations, forest transport, road construction, etc., as well as by significantly reducing the time for taking management decisions. Increased profitability occurs due to the identification of additional options for the sale of products.</p>

     <p>The results of an analysis of games in the Action/RPG genre and existing methods for personalizing their scenarios are presented, and the stages of developing a computer video game using methods for personalizing its scenarios are outlined. These include strengthening and weakening the player and opponents, as well as changing the environ­ment; approaches and technologies used to solve the problems of developing a system for gameplay personification of game scenarios and developing a software product are revealed. A description of the design stages by the authors of a Soulslike-style game application with the possibility of personalizing its scenarios, the results of functional testing and game performance in terms of the number of frames per second are presented.</p>
