     <p> This article describes the tool for finding problem with synchronization of drivers in Linux. This tool uses a method of detecting error basis on semantic models and allows you to detect such synchronization errors as infinity loops, deadlocks, and double locks. In addition, describe the process semantics of synchronization objects of Linux kernel in the language of asynchronous functional schemes

     <p> This paper is devoted to the description of the effectiveness of writing applications on programming languages Java and C++ for Android platform. In the article such parameters as the use of memory and the speed of program implementation are analyzed. All the advantages and disadvantages of Java and C++ are viewed. Finally, the conclusion about the suitability of mixed-use programming languages is made.

     <p> The paper reviews digital libraries' services. It is shown that one of the main tendencies of the development of digital c libraries' services is connected with personalization — adaptation to the user's interests. As a solution a new approach to automatic content analysis and an automatic system for content classification is suggested. It is based on the technology and solutions already worked out and implemented in the system Textanalyst. The paper describes the work of the system, results of testing, recommendations are given for using it in the electronic environment of digital libraries.

     <p> The paper presents approach that the authors have used to assess quality electronic dictionaries and encyclopedias on the basis of methodology qualimetry. Assessment methodology includes stage for determining the purpose of the evaluation, selection of the range of quality indicators, the base sample and the methods of determining the values of quality indicators for determining the values of quality indicators and assessment of scientific and technical level. The evaluation was conducted of 54 electronic dictionaries and encyclopedias, developed over the last 10—15 years by different companies.

     <p> The approach, in which analytical solution of the differential is offered the equations it is presented in the form of the massif of strings of the Java language with specially the coded sequences of symbols. To each symbol of a string its graphic representation including is put in compliance value of a symbol, its coordinates, the sizes, colour and the signs defining accessory of a symbol to numerator or a denominator of fraction. Transformed data for each symbol are collected to massives which are a basis for the illustrating programs, teaching programs and training programs. Features of programming are considered and examples of realisation are given the linear differential equations at their decisions methods of Lagrange and Bernulli-Fourier
