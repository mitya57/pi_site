     <p> The quantum cryptographic system AKM2017 is considered. The results of the analysis of the dependence of the degree of difference between the encryption and decryption gamut on the degree of difference between the corresponding session keys are presented. The equality of these degrees of distinction is revealed and substantiated. For an arbitrarily fixed encryption session key, the distribution of session decryption keys by classes is revealed and described, depending on the value of the degree of difference between the encryption and decryption gamuts. One class is made up of all session decryption keys, leading to the same value of the degree of difference between the encryption and decryption gamuts. A geometric interpretation of the specified distribution by classes is given in the form of placement along circles (class is a circle) on the surface of a sphere of unit radius centered at the origin of the Euclidean rectangular coordinate system in a three-dimensional linear space over the field of real numbers.
     The stated results can be used to solve the problems of optimizing the values of the parameters of accuracy and reliability of the functioning of variants of practical implementations of the quantum cryptographic system AKM2017, for example, when setting up a session decryption key, which makes it possible to guarantee a predetermined small value of the mathematical expectation of the number of incorrectly decrypted binary plain text.</p>

     <p> An increase in the degree of intellectualization of tasks requires the creation of methodology for improving the quality of intelligent decision-making systems. The possibility of automating decision-making in poorly formalized areas through the using of the expert knowledge leads to increasing of the number of errors in the software, and as a consequence to increasing of the number of various sources of failures.The article provides a detailed overview of existing methods and technologies for quality assurance of intelligent decision systems. The first part of the article describes the methodology for ensuring the quality of the intelligent systems (IS), based on the GOST/ ISO standards, where it is proposed to use a multilevel model to describe the quality of the IS software. It is shown that to ensure the required level of quality, an action plan can be formed and the use of a system dynamics model for the implementation of an action plan for ensuring the quality of IS is described. A comparative analysis of the complex criteria of quality and reliability is given. In the second part, the quality of knowledge base (KB) as a special element of the IS software is described, a comparative analysis of methods for static and dynamic analysis of knowledge bases is considered. An overview of research results in the classification of errors in the knowledge bases and their debugging is given. Special attention is given to the "forgetting about exception" type of errors. The concept of a statically correct knowledge base at the level of the knowledge structure is described and it is shown that statically correct knowledge bases can nevertheless give errors due to errors in the rules themselves because of the inconsistency of the field of studies. Neural network knowledge bases are allocated in a separate class, for neural networks methods of debugging are described. </p>

     <p> For polynomials of the third degree of a special type, expansions into linear factors are found. Various methods of factorization of fourth-degree polynomials of general and particular types are proposed. For polynomials of the sixth degree of a special kind, representations are given in the form of a product of polynomials of lower degrees. Special attention is paid to representations through square trinomials.
     The decomposition of the generalized reciprocal polynomial of the sixth degree into square trinomials is given.

     <p> The description and principles of developing a mobile application for the Android platform that provides free access to electronic courses on teaching the basic structures of the Python language and the construction of template programming algorithms based on them are presented. The content of the course is based on the principle of comparative analysis with the C++ language, one of the goals of which is to differentiate the tasks for which it is more efficient to use either the Python scripting language or the C++ compiler. The developed application is logically integral, allows the possibility of supplementing with new data — examples, types of algorithms — and, no less important, is free.</p>
