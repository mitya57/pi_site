     <p> As shown, Open Closed Principle in object oriented programming appears on program system microarchitecture level. Design patterns represent class hierarchies, which form a general solution of program system design problem. Techniques are under study, which are able to detect design pattern modified versions in program systems, differing from standard representations by additional inheritance level. An efficiency of program system component graph and design pattern graph similarity scoring method in use is demonstrated by detecting canonic and demonstrative examples of patterns written in Java code.

     <p> The problem of program projects viability estimation in the conditions of uncertainty generated by Not-factors is being considered. Multi-fuzzy and fuzzy-interval approaches to the decision of the given problem on the basis of comparative multicriterial analysis of possible design alternatives in the conditions of fuzzy initial data is offered.

     <p> A research of visual data encoding methods, designs of mathematical models of such data, software and management tools, as well as the analysis of the corresponding test results are given in the paper. The author develops an efficient, adaptive and interactive irregularly detailed raster image analysis method that is based on the propositions of the traditional SPIHT algorithm and gives an analysis of the software implementation properties on test images. This efficient method is developed with respect to the encoded data stream sizes, the image fragments extraction speed, the amount of data relevant to the fragments being extracted and the amount of random access memory used by the software.

     <p> An approach for Web authentication using Grid single sign-on capabilities is presented in the paper. This approach is based on HTTP GSSAPI authentication implemented in popular browsers, and it requres no additional software for clients. A functional prototype of a server-side component is provided for evaluation.

     <p> There are considered main types of errors in knowledge bases of expert systems, based on rules and on artificial neural networks. There are described methods of static and dynamic debugging of knowledge bases. Method of building of full set of tests for knowledge bases is suggested. There is described its using for testing of rule-based systems and for artificial intelligence systems based on 3-level perceptron.
