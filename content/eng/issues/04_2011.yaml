     <p> The methodological foundations of control system software product development and certification quality assurance is given in this paper. Two software system quality assurance methods are given: the engineering development process and the production-ready software product certification. Procedure structures and document content are presented for each of the methods at design, as well as at software system product development and certification.

     <p> As shown, Open Closed Principle in object oriented programming appears on program system microarchitecture level. Design patterns represent class hierarchies, which form a general solution of program system design problem. Techniques are under study, which are able to detect design pattern modified versions in program systems, differing from standard representations by additional inheritance level. An efficiency of program system component graph and design pattern graph similarity scoring method in use is demonstrated by detecting canonic and demonstrative examples of patterns written in Java code.

   item_annot: |
     <p> Logical access control is an important aspect of ensuring the security of information systems, including distributed ones. A subject of such system usually can access a remote object only with assistance of another subject, referred to as the trusting to the subject performing access. For this reason, one can use trust relations between subjects of the distributed system to control access to its objects. This article describes the software package, named Nettrust, designed to control trust relations in distributed computer systems.

   item_annot: |
     <p> This paper investigates the subject of usage of the R-Tree data structure as applied to the construction of software systems used for processing frequently changing geospatial data. It also illustrates emerging performance issues and proposes several approaches to resolve them. The experimentally calculated data for some of these approaches is presented here. As a result of the research, there have been implemented a number of algorithms of updating the R-Tree, which, in certain cases, are capable of increasing its performance.
