     <p>  The automated technology developed by the authors for assessing the state of progress and "health" in the framework of a software project based on the OMG ESSENCE standard is presented. Such an assessment is based on the degree to which the normal values of certain seven entities are achieved, which are the basis for the implementation of any software project. The values of entities are defined in the ESSENCE standard. A method for assessing the state of progress and "health" of the project is proposed, which allows automating the receipt of such assessments at each iteration of its implementation based on the analysis of checklists filled out by the project manager. In case of deviation of the results from normal values, a method for identifying dependencies is proposed based on the analysis of the graph of relationships built on the ESSENCE core. A service to automate the assessment is developed, technology implementation statistics are provided, estimates of errors of the first and second kind are obtained.</p>

     <p> The results of experiments on the circuit implementation of modular multipliers in the design library of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) are presented. The initial descriptions of modular multiplier projects were given by systems of not fully defined (partial) Boolean functions and algorithmic VHDL descriptions. Logical optimization was carried out in the class of disjunctive normal forms (DNF) and representations of Boolean function systems by BDD (Binary Decision Diagrams). The synthesized circuits were evaluated by area and time delay. It is established that the use of partial Boolean function models and preliminary logi­cal BDD optimization allows one to improve the parameters of synthesized ASIC and FPGA blocks for small module values, however, the best solutions for large module values can be obtained using algorithmic VHDL descriptions of modular multipliers. In the synthesis of modular multiplier circuits as part of an FPGA and the use of ISE and Vivado design systems it is advisable to use synthesized VHDL operations (a*b) mod p.</p>

     <p> The article is devoted to the development of formal mathematical methods for modeling business processes and the application of these methods to create intelligent assistants. The theory of partial models is used to formalize the workflow at the university department. The problem of creating an intelligent assistant for automated generation of university department documents is considered. To solve this problem, an ontological model of the subject area is developed and document templates are built. The focus is on the problem of automated generation of assuredly correct documents. The generation of documents occurs in three stages: a) creation of templates; b) automatic partial filling of documents with fixed information contained in the knowledge base; c) the final meaningful filling of documents by participants in the business process. Relationships between templates, prepopulated documents, and fully populated documents are formally described in terms of homomorphisms of partial models and submodel-supermodel relationships between partial models. Semantic Web technologies are used to search for and eliminate contradictions in the information presented in the knowledge base. Thanks to the automated filling of documents, the efficiency and quality of the produced documents are increased, as well as the time for working with them is reduced. The ability to flexibly change the developed ontological model allows you to optimize the work with documents in accordance with changing regulations</p>

     <p> In the presented work, a characteristic of the genetic algorithm is given on the example of solving the problem of minimizing the Schwefel function and the possibility of its acceleration using parallelization methods is determined. For the possibility of optimizing the program that implements the algorithm, an analysis of its «slowest» sections and the calculation of an approximate indicator of performance increase are given. As part of the ongoing optimization, it was possible to reduce the execution time of the algorithm by 1.63 times, which corresponds to preliminary calculations.</p>

     <p> This article describes a software module component integrated with the SIMULIA Abaqus engineering analysis software package and designed to simulate random values of material parameters in a finite element model based on specified statistical characteristics, with the possibility of taking into account the physical nonlinearity of material behavior under various combinations of loads and influences. The target group of materials under study is materials of load-bearing elements of building structures, such as concrete, stone, steel. This software module can be recommended for use by specialists, engineers and scientists engaged in probabilistic analysis of the reliability of structures of buildings and structures, apparatus, machines, devices, with the combined use of complexes of computer modeling and engineering analysis. Has a certificate of state registration of the computer program «AS for modeling stochastic properties of materials» No. 2019667439 dated 12.24.2019.
