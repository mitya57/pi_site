   item_name: Optimization of Mapping Programs to Computing Resources
   item_annot: |
      <p> Possibility to decline execution time of parallel programs with optimization of mapping programs to supercomputer resources is considered. The optimization process performs mapping application graph to parallel computer system graph. An application graph represents aggregate information on communication operations between parallel application's processes. It contains aggregate information about number of operations transmit/receive and the amount of data transferred for each processes pair. A system graph discloses a parallel computer system's communication structure. For each communication channel it comprises a latency values and bandwidth. Parallel implementation of the simulation annealing algorithm is proposed. The basic idea of the algorithm is the localization of communication exchanges between the intensity of the interaction program branches and reduce competition for communication resources. Building application graph and a parallel system graph are performed automatically using the developed software. Results of optimization test High Performance Conjugate Gradient execution on "MBC-10p" supercomputer resources using created software tools are presented. Time evaluation of mapping algorithm is done.

   item_name: Using Emulation Technics in the Development of Avionics Software Components
   item_annot: |
      <p> Development of the software emulation system, designed to support automated system software development process is considered. The emulator hardware platform enables the software components development stages early in the design: the development of software components is carried out on a computer tool, as the code testing, performed using emulator executable environment on the same instrumental machine. The authors suggest the principles of emulator construction. Software development tools used in emulator and functionality of the emulation software are described. Examples demonstrated: an example of the computing system's functional diagram and an example window of the emulator in debug mode. Also presented an algorithm of operating system test process performed on the emulator.

   item_name: Fingerprint Matching Algorithm Using a Constellation Structure
   item_annot: |
      <p> Fingerprint matching is a key problem in research of an automatic fingerprint identification system. This paper presents a novel algorithm to fingerprint verification using constellation structure based on Delaunay triangulation. Central to the proposed approach is the idea of associating a topological structure with the fingerprint minutiae using constellation structure.
      </p>
      <p>The proposed fingerprint matching algorithm is insensitive to fingerprint image distortion, scale and rotation. The proposed approach considers O(n3) operations. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a database FVC2002 DB1b of 80 fingerprints (8 fingerprints from 10 persons), demonstrating good performance.

   item_name: Genre Aspects of Websites Classification
   item_annot: |
      <p> The paper proposes an approach to the development of two-level genre models of communication on the Web. Genre category of a website as a whole (macro-level) corresponds to genre types of website constituents (pages and structural blocks) on the micro-level. Two types of pragmatic parameters are used to represent genres on both levels of consideration. Praxeological parameters, such as activity subject, beneficiary, product and environment, represent human activity that underlies communication and shows itself in the site structure, content and form of site constituents. Communicative parameters concern the hierarchy of communicative tasks, functionality of site constituents, and the affordances of communication channel. The type of anticipated reaction of the target audience in the hierarchy of communicative tasks forms the basis of website genre classification on the macro-level. Functions of site constituents together with channel features (interactivity, multimodality, and dynamics of content) determine genre types of web pages. The type of a textual page corresponds to genre schematic structure composed of content blocks. Identification of genre schemata as a succession of compositional blocks is possible due to a lexicon of genre markers (cue words and constructions) that are formalized as lexico-grammatical patterns provided with format conditions. The proposed genre models are realized in the website classification system.

   item_name: Development of the Information System for Scientific Conferences
   item_annot: |
      <p> The article describes the process of developing a new information system that is used in International scientific-practical conference "Object systems" (objectsystems.ru). Model of the existing system was obtained by reverse engineering. Analysis of the resulting models allowed to reveal design issues and to determine how to resolve them. There were defined the optimality criteria which are the requirements for system functionality: the ability to store information about different types of editions; about the authors; about the organizations; about the review of the article and their results; about the issues of various types of editions; about the articles; about the committees and the authors who are committee participants; about the nominations of articles; the ability to track the recommendations of the publication of articles in other editions; analytics module that displays information about the articles that are in a certain state, about the packages with collections and certificates sent to authors and about the issues for committee participants. Given the detected issues and the additional requirements a new formal model has been developed. With platform Sharp Architecture RAD Studio, using the MDA approach, the new model has been transformed into a finished system. All available data were saved and imported into the new system. The information system development process discussed in the article has demonstrated its effectiveness and practicality.
