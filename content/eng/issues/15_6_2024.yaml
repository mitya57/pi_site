     <p>The new language tools for processing trees based on nodes enumerators and determinants of the depth-first traversal are proposed. Node enumerators define a tree slice and set the directions and step of its breadth-first traversal: from left to right or from right to left, from root to crown or vice versa. The arguments of the nodes enumerators are the arithmetic series of their coordinates in the tree. The traversal determinants specify a way to recursively perform a depth-first traverse. The arguments of the determinants of the recursive depth-first traversal are the aliases of nodes and the ranks of references to their successors. The second-order functions and the recursive comprehension operators over trees similar to list comprehension operators are introduced.
     Using these tools allows for concisely expressing the operators to building and processing trees/slice without explicitly using recursion.</p>
   item_keywords: nodes enumerator, node coordinates, tree slice, code readability, code conciseness, higher-order function, recursive comprehensions

     <p>The article discusses various approaches to the organization of self-healing of complex systems. Modern technologies for the development of self-stabilizing systems, including reflection, graceful degradation and rejuvenation of system components, are analyzed. The role of artificial intelligence in self-treatment and self-healing of systems is considered.
     Modern hardware and software systems are becoming increasingly complex, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of events that may prevent the system from functioning normally. This can lead to huge losses for organizations that are becoming increasingly dependent on information systems. Various methods are traditionally used to minimize the risks associated with errors, attacks and failures. For example, an organization may decide to move to another resource in an alternative physical location (cloud), use data replication, backup servers, and so on. But as the system becomes more complex (more components, more external integrations), the implementation of some ways to ensure reliability and fault tolerance can be very expensive in terms of the resources needed for this.
     In this paper, we consider an integrated approach that allows an information system to fulfill its mission, called self-healing of systems.</p>

     <p>To ensure one of the key principles of the development of the state, namely, the achievement of technological sovereignty, it is necessary to build all spheres of life at a qualitatively new technological level, own their own innova­tive technologies. In modern sanctions realities, the development of enterprises in the Russian Federation cannot be carried out without coordination with partners from Russia, as well as from China, India and other friendly countries. The selection of potential partners can be carried out on the basis of the identified importance of their patented technological solutions. Further ranking of potential partners can be carried out on the basis of the identified importance of their patented technologies. At the same time, in this study it is proposed to use three criteria: the mass nature of the subject of the patented invention in the current period; the predicted mass nature of the subject (technology) in the future period; the popularity of the patent in the information field. The authors have developed a method for predicting the importance of patented technologies and its software implementation.</p>

     <p>The article presents an advanced method for creating knowledge graphs, applicable in medical decision support systems. It focuses on adapting the method to various clinical guidelines, making it particularly valuable in the medi­cal field. The developed universal ontological pattern allows for the formation of knowledge bases for a wide range of diseases, making the process flexible and scalable without the need for specific programming. This approach significantly reduces the labor intensity of creating medical support systems and facilitates their integration and adaptation to various clinical conditions and requirements.
     The practical significance of the method was confirmed in the management systems for the therapy of various diseases, including allergic rhinitis, underscoring its universality and applicability in the current medical context. The effectiveness of the proposed approach opens new perspectives for the development and improvement of medical information systems, contributing to the improvement of patient care and treatment quality. Thus, the article makes a significant contribution to the advancement of information technology in medicine, offering a solution that can be adapted for a wide range of medical applications and research.</p>

     <p>The article deals with the development of a method for ensuring the control of deviations in the automation of business processes on the example of the system of analytical control and forecasting in the electric power industry. On the basis of this method, it is possible to build a digital twin that allows one to control deviations of the developed business process models and create a ready model of the subject area of the information system depending on changes in business processes. In the article it is realized on the example of the rule of selection of the most accurate predictive results. The performed efficiency analysis showed that the most accurate result (with an error of 8.8 %) will be displayed in the web interface of the system of analytical control and power forecasting.</p>
