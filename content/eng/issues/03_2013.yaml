     <p> In this article kinds of changing programs, including self-organizing program systems, are considered. Types and conditions of self-organization are revealed. The artificial chemistry's theory models, in which the processes of software self-organizing are investigated, are considered. The concept of non-equilibrium programming, previously offered in works of the author, is considered also. The prospects of future development techniques and usage of self-organizing program systems are defined.

     <p> Consider the method of visualization of the results of thematic clustering of documents' collection. Pairwise-distance matrix is projected on plain using PCA. It is required to place the titles of dociments on plain. The loss function, which allows to reach a minimal overlap, is suggested. For its optimisation BFGS algorithm is used. Method suggested in the article is illustrated by visualization of conference's thesis.

     <p> Various approaches to solving abstracting automation problems are analysed. Formalisation of the process of building the structure of scientific and technical texts is considered. A text structure correctness criterion has been proposed and the corresponding structural characteristics and limitations have been introduced.

     <p> Various software packages are investigated that can be used in the design phase of gas-oil production facilities. It is shown that the software package Aspen ONE is one of the few software products that contain a set of applications for technical and economic analysis of the existing and complex modeling of new technologies and industries. It has a separate unit for equipment simulation, which can not be described by standard mathematical model presented in the libraries of software system. The features of the application of software package Aspen ONE are described at the design studies during the reconstruction of the existing production of trichlorosilane in Usolie-Sibirskoe of Irkutsk region.
