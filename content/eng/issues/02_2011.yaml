     <p> The article contains an analysis of the current state of the global software industry (GSI). General trends in industrys evolution are determined and analyzed. They include the movement of jobs toward local expertise on relevant professions, the transfer of critical IT-functionality in the outsourcing in specialized service companies, a growing interest in free software and the increase in acquisitions by leading companies the most successful competitors from the second echelon. Significant movements toward increasing quality requirements of both - software and programmers, as well as process engineering and technologies, lead us to conclusion about the possibilities of drastic changes in software engineering in nearest future.

   item_annot: |
     <p> The technology of development of the effective standard functions isqrt, floor, and ilog2 is described. Correctness of the programs is achieved by application of deductive verification and program synthesis methods. The proof of program correctness conditions is supported by the PVS Verification System.

     <p> This paper describes the importance of knowledge management of the cloud computing ecosystem. The methodology, the classification and organization ofdomain concepts, validation issues, analysis of some development tools, and the first pilot version of cloud computing ecosystem taxonomy is discussed. The cloud computing ecosystem taxonomy adds to current understanding of Cloud Services Innovation Semantic Workflow and Service Model Foundations; organization of Cloud Services domain knowledge in taxonomy form; identification and organization the concepts and instances (or examples) of concepts in a manner that achieves the taxonomys purpose and the types of clouds and the multilayer models of cloud services.
