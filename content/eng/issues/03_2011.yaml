     <p> Program system reengineering is an important domain of informatics using wide specter of scientific methods and technologies and attracting strong attention of researchers, engineers, and the business society. In particular, a reengineering project of a program system handling the problem of interest can establish a new knowledge about its characteristics. In the article we give a general description of reengineering and domains of its applications as well as we discuss issues appearing for automation of this activity.

     <p> In this article the visual system of source code quality analysis using metrics calculation is being described. Modern software products provide functionalities for counting source code metrics, but their values are non-normalized and dont have the limits of measurement. There are no software products that can interpret the numerical values of metrics to verbal recommendations up to date. The system provides the user the ability to load module for the analysis, calculate metrics, get text recommendations and report generation. The system can be used during software development for source code improvements.
