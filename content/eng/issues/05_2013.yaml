     <p> This paper is about image segmentation algorithm QuickShift. The goal of the research is to explore how various values of algorithm parameters affect on segmentation results. The results of experiments are quality evaluation of segmentation with different parameter values, the most suitable cases for each parameter value and some recommendation on parameters adjusting.

     <p> The article discusses the software implementation of intellectual electronic dictionary (IED) of robotics in the German language in the system of e-learning, as well as in the form of plug-language processor. Proposed hardware and technical architecture of IED selected models of knowledge representation, storage, and contents of the dictionary. The proposed solution provides the scalability, openness and virtuality. Shell IED provides the opportunity to work with a given subject area

     <p> We consider the problem of access control in object systems. From our point of view object approach combined with logical apparatus provides a natural and technological problem formulation. It is reasonable to apply the proposed approach to the framework of controlled execution.

     <p> Algorithms for topological ordering of a directed graph are widely used wherever necessary to produce a reasonable sequence of actions when one action is dependent on others. In this paper, topological sorting algorithm is used as the basic heuristic to construct an approximate algorithm for structural optimization of the control graph of the program in order to reduce the number of the test paths. The feature of the proposed algorithm is that it works not only with the directed acyclic graphs, but with the graphs containing the cycles.
