     <p> The lowering of power consumption in CMOS VLSI digital systems is one of the most important problems that appear now for developers of CAD systems. One of the effective approaches to lowering the dynamic power consumption is creation of an algorithmic description of the VHDL project, which provides for the deactivation of some functional blocks which are not necessary in particular moments. Contemporary synthesizers fulfill the high level synthesis of logic circuits by substitution of description of each VHDL construction with functionally structural description of a proper logic subcircuit. The results of digital logic circuit synthesis (the number of logic elements and power consumption) depend significantly on initial VHDL code. During initial VHDL code development it is possible to use different approaches to improve some parameters of synthesized logic circuit. At the algorithmic level of the digital design, it is necessary to provide for disconnection of the units, which cause the higher power consumption. In this paper such methods of algorithmic VHDL description of logic circuit are studied. The efficiency of the proposed methods is compared with the traditional method of VHDL-description which does not take the aspect of power con­sumption into account and is oriented only to the correct functionality of the developed logic circuit. To estimate the power consumption of logic circuits the approach is used which allows applying high-speed logical VHDL-simulation of structural descriptions (netlists) of logic circuits instead of slow SPICE simulation. The main conclusion of the provided study is the following: the clock gating and the storage of operand values for complex operations as well as zero value setting for simple ones are effective methods for the VHDL description of operational units with low power consumption implemented in the CMOS basis.

     <p> The article describes the architecture of connected JavaScript components, which allows you to implement the interaction of many scripts connected in a web project asynchronously and executable at any time and in any order. The architecture is based on the idea of dividing code into components, JavaScript events and listening to them. This approach is intended to relieve the developer from the need to organize the sequence of connecting scripts in an HTML-document, track their loading time and select the loading method, which gives great opportunities for expanding and flexibility of the code.</p>

     <p> This report presents a new version of Structure Splitting optimization, implemented for the compiler for Elbrus and SPARC processors. Structure Splitting tries to improve data locality by splitting arrays of structures into arrays of smaller structures. This solution helps to decrease probability of cache misses, which leads to execution time decrease. The optimization was generalized for the case of array of structures nested in another structure and possibility of its reallocation. Execution speed of two tests from SPEC CPU2000 and SPEC CPU2006 increased by 19 and 12 %. </p>

     <p> A description of the method of numerical study in the approximation of a narrow channel of the problems of flow and heat transfer in flat and circular channels of variable cross-section using a differential three-parameter model of shear turbulence is presented. The main results of numerous studies using the proposed method are described, one of the goals of which was to substantiate the possibility of using the narrow channel approximation. This review study is carried out in two parts. In the second part the results of the study of laminarization during flow in the con-fuser and the pipe, heat transfer intensification during flow in diffusers and in a plate heat exchanger with diffuser channels are presented. </p>

     <p> The article presents methods for caching and displaying data from spectral satellite images using libraries of distributed computing systems that are part of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, and GeoServer extensions. The authors gave a brief overview of existing tools that provide the ability to present remote sensing data using distributed information technologies. A distinctive feature is the way to convert remote sensing data inside Apache Parquet files for further display. This approach allows you to interact with the distributed file system via the Kite SDK libraries and switch on additional data processors based on Apache Hadoop technology as external services. A comparative analysis of existing tools, such as: GeoMesa, GeoWawe, etc is performed. The following steps are described: extracting data from Apache Parquet via the Kite SDK, converting this data to GDAL Dataset, iterating the received data, and saving it inside the file system in BIL format. In this article, the BIL format is used for the GeoServer cache. The extension was implemented and published under the Apache License on the GitHub resource. In conclusion, you will find instructions for installing and using the created extension. </p>
