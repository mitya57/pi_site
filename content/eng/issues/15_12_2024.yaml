     <p>This paper presents the results of research aimed at evaluating the scalability of distributed fault-tolerant systems for iterative task execution. The study focuses on peer-to-peer distributed systems capable of executing tasks iteratively according to a schedule, where the nodes are coordinated through a key-value store. The operation of such systems is based on Recurrent Worker Service (RWS) algorithms. The primary focus is on studying the dependency of metrics such as iteration accuracy and resource utilization on the number of system nodes, including both application and storage nodes. The experimental environment is deployed in Yandex Cloud infrastructure and consists of four servers, one of which is low-performance and three are high-performance. Tests were conducted under three scenarios: application node scalability, storage node scalability, and simultaneous scalability of both node categories. During the tests, performance differences between the two modes of RWS algorithms were studied. The results obtained in this work can be used in the design and optimization of distributed systems that require high performance and fault tolerance.</p>

     <p>The article discusses the process of developing a geoinformation system reflecting the level of accessibility of financial services in the settlements of the region under consideration. Relevant GIS used in various countries and for a wide range of tasks are analyzed, for example, to display the location of medical schools in India, to select the location of solar power plants in Mecca, to analyze aspects of sustainable development of the Vologda Oblast of Russia. Some map constructors are also considered, their advantages and disadvantages are revealed. Based on the analyzed tools, the main criteria that the developed GIS should meet are formulated.
     The next part of the article describes the structure of the tool being developed, consisting of three levels of visualization and two blocks of data storage. The structure of the database for storing information about settlements is presented, and the block for storing coordinates of municipal boundaries is described. The process of creating a border drawing module based on two-dimensional arrays with geographical points, along which polylines are built, taking into account the map scale and map distortions vertically and horizontally, is described. The following is an analysis of the module for displaying the location of settlements based on a bubble diagram, in which latitude and longitude act as values along the X and Y axes, and the size is determined by the number of inhabitants. When describing the module for displaying the availability of financial instruments in settlements, it describes the possibilities to simulta­neously demonstrate the location of settlements, the level of financial accessibility in settlements, the presence or absence of specific financial infrastructure tools, municipal and regional borders.
     The main advantages of the developed product over similar ones are the ability to work in a completely offline mode without an Internet connection, maximum data detail, the ability to filter settlements by population. The developed GIS for visualization and analysis of the spatial distribution of financial services can help in planning the development of cities and regions.</p>

     <p>The purpose of the study is to substantiate the possibility and potential effects of using a new approach and class of models based on sociophysical analogies for modeling and managing conflicts in the business processes of research and development of an organization. A research methodology is proposed, based on the modern post-non-classical paradigm (synthetic picture of the world), formed on the principles of global evolutionism, interdisciplinarity, openness and nonlinearity; sociophysical approach for studying social conflicts and their modeling; historical method of study­ing social phenomena in time and determining the connection between past, present and future, critical-dialectical method of analyzing contradictions of social groups as a source of change, methods of system analysis of conflict as a complex process self-developing over time and system synthesis to resolve social contradictions in the process of development and implementation innovation of the organization.
     It is shown that employees of an organization can be divided into two groups depending on their attitude to new ideas, technologies and style of behavior when solving new creative problems — innovators and adapters. When developing and implementing innovations, project teams should include workers of both types. The presence of workers in the same team with antagonistic positions can lead to conflict situations. It is substantiated that for the modeling and management of such social conflicts, methods and models of sociophysics can be applied, providing a representation of the conflict as a change in behavioral reactions, and aimed at ensuring the cohesion of group members and their depolarization.
     The significance of the study is the ability to analyze the contradictions of interests of participants in the process of their interactions when implementing the tasks of developing and implementing innovations based on a sociophysical approach. The developed methodology takes into account the identified features of research and development processes, as well as complex intra-group and inter-group connections of conflicting groups, and allows us to develop requirements for modeling processes of conflict interaction and forecasting the options and nature of its development.</p>

     <p>The paper considers the issues of developing a technology for creating a hybrid educational environment, including, along with real research laboratories, various virtual laboratories with the possibility of fully immersing schoolchildren in their space, which would increase the level of vocational guidance for schoolchildren, namely: improving their knowledge of professions, interest in engineering areas, confidence in the choice a future career, the development of professionally significant competencies; and would also be very attractive to them. The authors of the work focus on the virtual component of the hybrid educational environment of the university's engineering school. The formal description of the technology uses functional diagrams in the IDEF0 notation. The following basic programming environments are used as development tools: Twinmotion, Bigscreen, 3DVista Tour, LMS Moodle.</p>
