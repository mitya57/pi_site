     <p>  The purpose of the research, the results of which are presented in the article, is to present the conceptual provisions of the new modeling and programming technology, called radical. It is intended for all stages of the life cycle of complex automated systems using the concept of a broad problem area and the methodology of intellectualization. Within the framework of the new radical technology, three principles of intellectualization are considered: diverse goal setting; necessary information and system redundancy; sufficient integrity in the provision of automation tools. Radical technology is based on mathematical objects — radicals and radical schemes, with the help of which the modeling of the problem area of complex automated systems should be carried out. The issues of standardization of technology for the creation and maintenance of automated systems based on the use of radical schemes are discussed. The necessity of using such schemes in the life cycle of an automated system is substantiated. The provisions of the proposed technology are briefly illustrated on the basis of the experience of their use in the development of programs for the operation of the target equipment of spacecraft. The issues of software development for automation of control processes of permanently developing and increasingly complex objects have always been and remain in the focus of attention of specialists in the field of computer science. A special place in the list of such objects is occupied, for example, by complexly organized systems of the aerospace complex. Due to the need to automate and intellectualize the processes of maintaining such a class of objects in a real environment, a new methodology and technology of software development and maintenance engineering is being developed in Russia and other countries.
     The problem area of complex automated systems, which include, inter alia, space systems, covers a large number of diverse components of such systems, their properties and relationships. This class of automated systems is characterized by: variability; expansion of functionality; the need for the use of rapidly developing software and hardware for various purposes. The problem area of automated systems is characterized by both significant achievements and significant shortcomings. Disadvantages can (and do) lead to large-scale, irreparable losses, accidents and catastrophes. The presence of problem­atic issues of verification and ensuring a high degree of reliability, difficulties of modification and the possibility of semantic errors — all this is characteristic of modern automated systems, for their software and hardware.
     The reason for the disadvantages of complex automated systems is the widespread use of technologies in their develop­ment that do not adequately cover the stages of pre-project research, including modeling. The old approach is character­ized by situations in which the problem area of an automated system, its components and their connections are not fully described. Hence the objective difficulties of software development and modification. The documentation of such software tools is characterized by the widespread use of information representation based on natural language. Automation of the processes of development and maintenance of such documentation, assessment of its completeness, correctness is sig­nificantly difficult. Mathematical formalization of the problem area of automated systems, as a rule, is insufficient. In this article, a new mathematical standardization of the formal description of the problem domain of automated systems and processes occurring in them, uniformly described on the basis of the concept of radical, is proposed. The most well-known of the approaches based on the methodology of software engineering applied to automated systems is the SEMAT (Soft­ware Engineering Method and Theory) project. The core and the domain model description language make up the basic part of the project, called Essence. An essential requirement for its components is the requirement of the possibility of an adequate and visual description for developers and an adequate (objective) assessment of the state of the target software product at all stages of its production. The project proposed in this article, based on the model of radical programming and radical modeling, is an analogue of the SEMAT/Essence project noted above. The model considered in this article is based on a uniform mathematically formalized standardization of the description of any problem area and its environment. The so-called radicals and the mechanisms of their interaction during the implementation of automated processes are considered as the basic atomic elements that make up the core of our approach. Within the framework of this model, a special modeling language, RADICAL, has been developed, taking into account the redundancy of the model description. With the help of such a language, an expressive, flexible and adequate representation of the problem area is provided, visually convenient for the developer to assess the condition of the target product at different stages of its life cycle.
     The development and improvement of methods for mathematically rigorous description of automated systems and their environment based on such technology is a strategically important task. This publication attempts to describe the current state of exploratory research and applied work aimed at developing a project called «radical modeling and radical programming». The material presented in the publication, including a summary of the results in relation to the automation of objects in the aerospace field, can also be considered as an invitation to new researchers to participate in the work on the development of the project. The experience of practical application of the RADICAL language, as a universal one for describing schemes of interaction of radicals in such an environment, obtained when solving problems of automation of control of the instrument base of spacecraft for various purposes, suggests the urgent need to develop and develop a single, constantly expanding library of standard information forms designed to solve different classes of tasks. Such an expandable library of information forms (libraries of radicals) should lay the foundation for a developing knowledge base of radical technology in the context of a rapidly progressing variety of software and hardware.</p>

     <p> Currently, the use of distributed (cloud) resources is becoming more and more widespread. Despite the high reliability of equipment used in call centers, failures do occur. And if long-term storage systems have high reliability due to multiple duplication, then the failure of the server on which the task is performed in specialized computing systems (SCS) can correspond to the failure of the entire system. In order to eliminate it, a simulation model of a specialized computing system built in the Simulink (SimEvent) environment, classified in the queuing theory as G/G/n/, is investigated. It is characterized by many input streams with an infinite queue, has two feedbacks, reflecting reprocessing situations in case of a server failure or no solution at the first service attempt. The system architecture is focused on the parallel execution of a certain class of tasks, divided into data-independent sub-tasks. The main criterion for the functioning of such a system is the completion of all received tasks in a time not exceeding the deadline for their implementation. The purpose of the work, the results of which are presented in the article, is to study the reliability of the functioning of such a system for various values of the probability of server failure. Since the performance and efficiency of such a system has already been studied in previous works, the main direction of research will be focused on the impact of server failures on overall productivity and efficiency under various laws of input flows.</p>

     <p> The problem of anomaly detection when several information technologies (processes) are functioning simultaneously is considered. It is assumed that the normal or typical functioning of the process can be described by some formal model. In this paper a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is considered as such formal model. It is considered that all necessary information about the processes possible executions can be received from an event log, which is considered given.
     In this paper the event log traces containing the data from one and several processes were examined. The complexity estimates for solving anomaly detection problem with the use of the constructed earlier formal models are determined.
     It has been shown that the solution of the anomaly detection problem has linear complexity with respect to the length of the trace, for which it is required to give an answer whether such trace contains an anomaly. Also, it has been proven that the solution of the anomaly detection problem has quadratic complexity with respect to the maximum possible number of actions and dependencies in one simulated process. Moreover, it has been demonstrated how the system of different representatives may help to effectively identify the trajectories of many different processes.</p>

     <p> The developed method for imputing retrospective data to improve the accuracy of long-term neural network fore­casting is considered. The peculiarity of the method is to increase the accuracy of the predictive values of the time series obtained at the output of the recurrent neural network by increasing the amount of historical data provided by the production department of the Kumertau Electric Networks.
     Using the example of forecasting the values of electricity consumption, an experiment was carried out on data imputation, which proves the effectiveness of using this method to improve accuracy in forecasting time series.
