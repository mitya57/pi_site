     <p>  The lack of a user identification system and the existence of a variety of ways to obfuscate a transaction on the Bitcoin network is of great interest to attackers and can be used by them to conduct illegal activities. There is a need to develop new methods of cash identification in the Bitcoin network. The purpose of this work is to develop a method of transaction verification in the Bitcoin network to improve the efficiency of the process of identification of illegally obtained funds and their sources. The work solves the following tasks: the development of a method for transaction verification in the Bitcoin network and the development of a decision support system, which includes the proposed method. The article describes each of the stages of the method: collection, aggregation, processing and analysis of information. The information analysis stage proposes a clustering method that takes into account an extended set of empirical rules (heuristics) of transaction analysis, as well as information about Bitcoin network address owners. The scientific novelty lies in increasing the efficiency of the identification process of illegally obtained funds and their sources through a comprehensive analysis of transactions, including the extended collection of information and its subsequent aggregation in the multi-model database of the decision support system. In contrast to existing methods, the reliability of the identification of Bitcoin network subjects is increased through the use of intelligent methods of data analysis. The results of this work will provide an opportunity to develop new and improve existing transaction analysis tools in future research, which will allow more effective identification of funds in the Bitcoin network associated with illegal activities.</p>

     <p> The article presents an effective algorithm for calculating the correctly rounded exponent for any of the rounding modes specified by the IEEE 754 standard. The argument and the function value are double-precision numbers, but the algorithm itself uses extended double-precision arithmetic for calculations. At the argument reduction stage, we approximate the argument with numbers whose exponent value has a short mantissa, which makes calculations faster. The article gives a formal description of the algorithm and a proof of its correctness. The function has the shortest maximum execution time among the considered functions calculating correctly rounded exponent. The execution time slightly depends on the value of the argument, which may be important for critical applications.</p>

     <p> Now more and more information is transmitted via the Internet, including through websites. The speed with which sites are displayed to users affects their attitude to the resource they are viewing, and therefore, the speed also affects the success of the resource itself. For example, search engines will be less likely to offer users resources with lower behavioral factors. Despite this, the display speed of many sites is low. This state of affairs harms both the end user of information and the owners of Internet resources. To fix the download speed, you can apply content reflow to optimize the html document. Manually making such edits is a rather time-consuming process. It can be accelerated by automating content reflow through special algorithms. The aim of the work is to optimize the structure of the HTML page to increase the speed of its full display by the browser. A list of services is provided that allows you to check the page loading speed. The text describes the "mirror" script, designed to create copies of web site pages, to test html content optimization algorithms. Descriptions of algorithms developed to solve the problem of low download speed are given. The article presents the results of content optimization on the example of two sites. The full page rendering speed measurement model provided by the Google PageSpeed Insights tool was used, which includes the following metrics: First Contentful Paint (FCP), Speed Index (SI), Total Blocking Time (TBT), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). The developed algorithms for automatic reflow of html documents show their effectiveness in optimizing page loading speed according to Lighthouse 9 and 10 versions.</p>

     <p> A modern specialist in the field of maintenance and repair of rolling stock needs to constantly have access to up-to-date information about the technical condition, equipment and location of serviced units. This article analyzes the existing software products and applications that allow you to plan and manage the processes of repair work and operation. The work is devoted to the creation of products for finding up-to-date information about the technical condition of rolling stock units both on a personal computer and in an online application environment. Programs have the ability to be updated and supported, including bug fixes. The use of the proposed tools will allow a specialist in the field of logistics, maintenance and repair of rolling stock to increase the efficiency of forecasting, organization of transport processes and repair work. The algorithms of operation of each software product are formed in the work. The algorithms are presented in the form of flowcharts. The generated database is presented. Geometric parameters and wheelset numbers, dates of the last maintenance and overhaul, location were added to the presented database in accordance with the number. An array of data with photos of car was also created. The article presents a text written in the Python programming language. This language made it possible to fully implement the algorithm of the products actions. During the testing of the programs, the operation of the main functions was checked, namely, the search for parameters by the composition number. The work solved the problem of displaying photos and videos on the screen at the users request. This function will reduce the time to choose a rolling stock unit for rent and control the quality of repairs. The results of the work of programs in the environment of online applications and on a personal computer are presented in the form of drawings. When creating a software product in an online application environment, the issue of data transfer security (whitelist, password encryption, end-to-end encryption, as well as copy and forwarding protection) was resolved.</p>
