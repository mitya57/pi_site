     <p> Modern real-time operating systems (RTOS) have some characteristics related to the particular of inferior quality. In this paper typical RTOS developers errors discussed, as well as methods of diagnosis and detection of these errors based on the use of static analysis of source code

     <p> The paper considers the problem of automated model-driven application development for Smart-M3 when structure of problem domain is specified as OWL-ontology. Each software agent uses its own OWL-ontology to access the smart spaces in accordance with its role and interests. Given the ontology, the code of ontological library is generated in a target programming language. Transformation of the high-level OWL-model of problem domain into the low-level RDF-model of Smart-M3 is hidden from the developer. Our solution is realized in SmartSlog, a high-level software development kit for Smart-M3.

     <p> In this article are regarded questions of receiving of WSDL interface on base of principle "Top-Down", etc. from models to code by transformation of models of business level to code level. General target of transformation — to resolve of problem of decomposition of information system corresponding to business processes. This target is reaching. This corresponds to main conception SOA — confluence of business logic with logic of information technologies realizing this business logic.

     <p> This article is devoted to module description that increases the efficiency of pathologies and morphological changes detection in the gastrointestinal tract and its sections on the images from the wireless endoscopic capsule. The method of bleeding and sections detection of the gastrointestinal tract is based on pixel analysis. Detection of polyps is based on analysis of convexity of the surface. 3D-models are constructed and measured. The algorithm indicates that in the original image at the pixel corresponding to this element a polyp takes place.

     <p> The paper analyzes the architecture of the expert networks and their place in the overall spectrum of information technology. The author displays the functionality difference between network of experts and the social network. The paper points to correlation the appearance of postcrowdsourcing technology and the "information explosion". The different paths of development of postcrowdsourcing technology are described.
