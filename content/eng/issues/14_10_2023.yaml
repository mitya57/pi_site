     <p>  The purpose of the article is to study methods of migration to other environments of information systems previously created in Microsoft Windows in the C# language. These environments either belong to the open class, or were developed directly in Russia. One of the main migration tools is the separation of systems into components. In this case, the transformation tasks of each component are solved separately.
     Methods of transformation of information systems functioning in an environment based on operating systems, database management tools, web tools, frameworks and libraries are considered.
     The main directions of preparation of the executive environment, the components of which are included in the register of Russian software, or provide open source codes, are highlighted.
     Operating systems that meet the given criteria are selected. Basically, these systems are founded on Linux kernel. Methods for configuring the Apache 2 web server and creating a virtual host are defined. A brief assessment of database migration methods was carried out. The issues of correcting the C# source code when changing the operating environment and methods of converting the source text when changing the ways of working with the graphical user interface are considered. The main problems during the transition to the new system and ways to solve them are shown.
     Taking into account the mandatory code correction required during the migration process and the development of a new graphical user interface, the transition from Windows to Linux is possible at real time-consuming costs. Using existing methods of migrating databases, web services and client applications allows you to complete the migration of information systems based on the C# language into environments that meet the criteria for import substitution.</p>

     <p> This article discusses the issues of improving the reactivity and stability of web-based geographic information systems. It proposes a solution based on the integration of well-known web design patterns, which provides high internal and low external coupling of modules in the plugin architecture of the application. A prototype system was developed utilizing web design and programming patterns such as Model-View-Controller pattern and message-based communication between modules. The experiment was conducted on the dataset based on the results of registering the values of the Earths geomagnetic field parameters and its variations. The experiment demonstrates increased performance when using the suggested approach. The results show a reduction in server response time by 47 %.</p>

     <p> Today, the Bitcoin network faces a number of challenges, such as flawed user identification and fraudulent transaction methods that are used by criminals to conduct illegal activities. As a result, there is a growing need to improve existing tools for tracking transactions, as well as to develop new methods for identifying money in the Bitcoin network. The paper presents a study and systematization of the subject area problems, and also considers possible approaches to neutralize it. The purpose of this work is to analyze the existing methods of transaction verification of the Bitcoin network. Within the framework of the work, a system architecture is proposed, which includes a comprehensive approach to the process of transaction analysis. Each of the stages of this process is described: information gathering, aggregation, processing and analysis. An extended set of empirical rules (heuristics) for transaction analysis, which are used in existing clustering methods, is considered. The results of this work will provide an opportunity to improve the existing Bitcoin transaction verification methods and develop a new one with the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the process of identification of illegally obtained funds and their sources.</p>

     <p> The study considers modeling and automating the processes of data collection and processing in a smart medical ward. We examined the existing solutions in the field of smart wards. Such solutions allow to increase patient safety, improve the quality of their treatment, optimize workflows in inpatient facilities, reduce costs and increase comfort of the patients. At the same time, these solutions are focused on particular tasks, use varied technologies and protocols, and implement single scenarios for the functioning of the ward. This is not enough to create an integrated approach to automating patient treatment in smart wards, as there are problems of compatibility and integration of heterogeneous modules, systems and protocols, which leads to growing costs and reduced profitability. To avoid these problems, the complex must be implemented within a single framework with typical components, connections, and operation scenarios. To do this, at the first stage of the work, a conceptual model of a smart room is proposed, a description of its components is given, and scenarios of their functioning are provided. An algorithm for collecting and processing data for diagnosis and stratification of diseases has also been developed, a simulation of the smart ward operation has been carried out, and it showed that the implementation of data collection and processing using smart components can reduce the processing time at least twice.</p>

     <p> The article presents the results of solving the problem of developing a neural network technology for analyzing traffic flows in automated traffic control systems. Methods for analyzing traffic flows using various technologies, existing systems for analyzing traffic flows based on neural network technologies and technologies for detecting and tracking objects on a video stream in order to ensure traffic safety are described. The algorithms used in the operation of neural network technology are described, including the stages of object detection; tracking of detected objects; identifying incidents; automatic collection of information from video streams; collecting statistics. According to the results of approbation (testing) of the implemented neural network technology on own (prepared) and used video data downloaded from the Internet, the reliability of the results of the study of video frames (correct recognition of traffic flow objects) in the neural network traffic control system was 85—90 %. Errors occurred in the presence of a large number of objects on a video frames and poor quality of the video stream. When monitoring the parameters of the traffic flow, the collection, analysis and provision of aggregated data on the traffic situation on the road section were ensured. Automatic collection of information from video files is implemented up to the file time without refer­ence to real time. The statistical data obtained during the study can be used in automated traffic control systems to analyse traffic flows and in other control and decision-making systems to increase the responsiveness to incidents.
     The results obtained can be applied in traffic flow studies to obtain accurate statistics and forecast anomalies and incidents (traffic accidents, traffic jams) in order to ensure traffic safety.
