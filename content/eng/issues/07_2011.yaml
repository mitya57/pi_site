     <p> Discovery of resources available for remote use is a significant part of building composite applications in a distributed network environment. The present paper is devoted to resource discovery in grid systems. A brief review of existing approaches to the problem is presented. A novel method for resource discovery in grid systems is proposed. It is based on formal semantic descriptions of algorithms that are implemented by grid services. The descriptions are written in terms of a domain ontology. Some examples of using the approach are presented in the paper.

     <p> Development teams are likely to have lots of difficulties while making more or less accurate estimations on a project: time assumptions, work assessments and required budget. One of the possible solutions could be plotting down a diagram of new defects against time. For different types of applications, big and tiny, these plots are sure to have similar characteristics. The ways making project time consumption estimations based on such plot is suggested and recommendations how to use this plot planning future release dates.

     There are various methodologies analyzing multithreaded algorithms. The article contains description and substantiation of the new approach to the problem of searching data-races in multithreaded programs. Suggested approach is basing on the static code analysis including analysis of some extra auxiliary constructions and also includes little computational part.

     <p> This paper is devoted to the problem of distributed virtual reality (DVR) systems design which is important and relevant at the present time. An approach based on the creating of a specialized middleware allowing to simplify and at the same time to accelerate DVR system development is proposed.
     In the second part of paper mechanisms to ensure data consistency in the proposed software architecture are considered. In addition the main features and implementation details of the TerraNet middleware are examined.

     <p> We consider the modern approaches to estimating risks to information security of corporate information system. The analysis of software systems intended for estimation of such risks is carried out. We present an approach to risk analysis based on construction of formal models of precedents of cyber attacks. Mathematical foundations of the presented approach are stated. Finally we describe software system RiskPanel which is an implementation of our approach.
