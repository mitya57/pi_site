   item_name: "Application of Numberings Theory Methods for Representation of Software Agents's Code Evolution in Temporal Databases"
   item_authors_address: '<b> E. A. Kolchugina </b>, e-mail: kea-sci@list.ru'
   item_annot: |
     <p> In this paper we are considering questions of evolutionary software agents's code representation in temporal databases. The methods of convolutions performance on the basis of numbering of the Cantor are considered. To reduce the growth of the convolution function's value it is offered to use the pairing tree-like scheme.

   item_annot: |
     <p> Nowadays the new filed in programming general purpose computations on graphics processor units — GP GPU is developing dramatically. Peak performance of graphics processor units (GPU) is much higher than one of central processors.
     </p><p>In this paper the opportunity of using GPU for computation with extended-length numbers is shown. Two variants of algorithms of arithmetic operations are proposed. The application field of proposed algorithms is shown.

   item_name: Experience with a University Course on Software Design
   item_authors_address: '<b> A. S. Khritankov </b>, e-mail: anton.khritankov@acm.org'
   item_annot: |
     <p> In this paper, we discuss our experience with a university course on software design included in software engineering curricula at MIPT. The course has been delivered six times; the total audience is more than a hundred students. We explain why we do not strictly follow IEEE/ACM recommendations (SEEK), how we organize student assignments, what tools we employ and results we have achieved.
