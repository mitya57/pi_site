     <p> Internet of things technology is developing at an exceptionally fast pace. This applies to both industrial and consumer Internet. The "things" account for billions, and many areas of application have been formed. At the same time, the state of information security of the Internet of things is not satisfactory, and protective measures are clearly inferior to Commerce. This is especially dangerous because the Internet of things spans two worlds: digital and physical, and security breaches can cause both informational and physical damage.
     The Internet of things is developing rapidly, so it is natural that it experiences typical growth diseases-fragmentation and uneven development. The base for ensuring security is mostly formed (but continues to be formed), the question is how quickly there will be a harmonization of approaches, and advanced ideas will be accepted by device manufacturers. Many state and non-state agencies actively promote security tools, inform and train manufacturers and consumers.
     The article is an overview of the main provisions of information security of the Internet of things. An attempt is made to consider software and technical and legislative levels of Internet of things security. This makes it different from other publications of a similar nature. Only a holistic, integrated approach can improve real information security.
     Authors outline basic concepts and describe a reference model of Internet of things, draw attention to the peculiarities of the Internet of things that are important from the security point of view, enumerate typical threats for Internet of things.
     The legislative level of information security, security recommendations for the Internet of things, manufacturers description of usage, and installation of software corrections are considered in detail.

     <p> The analysis carried out in the article shows the possibility of creating a problem-oriented VLSI, fabricated according to the technological standards of 28 nm or less, for at least one family of digital signal processing problems using similar computing nodes in structure. The use of distributed arithmetic allows one to apply a technique based on performing only those multiplication steps for which non-zero digits are set in the corresponding positions of the filter coefficients. Therefore, the performance of 200 nodes executing 2 steps at 1 GHz is equivalent to approximately 80 GMAC/s/mm2 for 16-bit coefficients. The VLSI architecture view opens up the possibility to study the effectiveness of implementing other families of tasks and refine the architectural parameters for their implementation. The proposed functionality of VLSI computing nodes allows them to be used in various fields of technology, which potentially increases the need for the release of such VLSI.</p>

     <p> We investigate covert channels that use players moves to transmit information. We assume that there exits noise generated by periods of invisiblility of the transmitting player (due to network failures, game mechanics, etc.); thus there arises the problem of reliable transmission of information over a noisy channel. The formal model that addresses this problem is referred to as a structure of partial erasure. In the framework of the model we prove the criterion of equivalence of a pair of trajectories on the receiving end of the channel. We also discuss a number of methods that prevent organization of covert channels of the type considered. </p>

     <p> This article focuses on results of developing the system for managing the life time of equipment and pipelines of nuclear power plants (NPP). The system is designed to calculate the intensity of Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) and a residual lifetime of elements.
     In Russia, the development of software for calculating the speed of FAC and value of thinning of the walls of pipelines of NPP has been carried out since the early 90s of the last century. The existing version of the software package for calculating the characteristics of FAC is implemented of loosely coupled software modules (standalone programs). There is no single concept of architecture, therefore, any modernization and addition of functionality comes down to rewriting old programs or writing new programs, loosely connected with the old ones.
     This article contains results of research of the feasibility of implementing a software package for monitoring FAC in the form of a set of plug-in modules. This approach allows one to easily add new functionality without overwriting the existing kernel by adding or removing modules. Based on the general concept, several modules for calculating the characters of FAC and visualizing the control data have been developed.

     <p> This paper explores the tasks of personalized support of the museum, for which it is proposed to use digital services. Services implement the selection of information sources using an additional semantic level. The seman­tic level is created above the catalog-oriented information storage of the museum. An ontological model has been developed, in accordance with which information is presented in the form of a semantic network. The local ranking model of semantic network objects is proposed, on the basis of which a ranking algorithm is developed. The software implementation of the local ranking algorithm in digital services of personalized support is presented on the example of the Museum of History of Petrozavodsk State University. The services provide personalized recommendations to museum visitors when studying the exposition. It requires various options for ranking exhibits and selecting exhibits with the highest rank.
