     <p>The paper examines the results of studies aimed at developing and testing a model for reviewing scientific and technical publications with the aim of using it to solve the problem of ranking scientific journals. The indicators that can be used for ranking include not only traditional bibliometric indicators of a journal, statistical data about it (for example, the number of issues and articles per year), but also information about the members of the editorial board, reviewers, the process and results of reviewing. Based on the experience of working with both individual journals and a large interactive information system analyzing such journals, the authors propose a model for collecting and storing information about reviewing, as well as a method for taking this and other data into account when categorizing journals and, as a result, increasing the efficiency of their editorial boards. The described model can be useful for the editorial boards of journals themselves, since it allows for the automation of various complex processes, such as the selection of reviewers and correspondence between reviewers, authors and the editorial board.</p>

     <p>The schemes for modeling complex integrated semantic structures and describing the content of knowledge do­mains by embedding these structures into ontologies of such areas are investigated. Such schemes are implemented as descriptions of processes operating with special classes of abstract and subject knowledge. Abstract knowledge classes allow the representation of the content of a knowledge domain using abstract knowledge structures. In intel­ligent systems, such structures are constructed by operations within the knowledge synthesis processes. A unified format of semantic hierarchy formalisms is used to represent content fragments. To construct structures within abstract classes of structures, special relations are defined. That allows the formation of complex knowledge structures in ontologies. Individual subject knowledge represents a designation of a certain entity or a formal description of a property, which is used as an element of the semantic structure of a knowledge domain. Such knowledge forms classes of subject knowledge in ontologies, which allow one to adapt elements of abstract structures to the content of knowledge domains. The applying of abstract structures in ontologies of knowledge domains allows the development of algorithms for the processes of analysis and synthesis of complex objects presented at the abstract level of the ontology. Relations between classes of abstract and subject knowledge within an ontology allow complex semantic structures to be included in ontologies. This allows us to develop algorithms for the implementation of cognitive goals and thought processes based on the synthesis of semantic structures from elements of knowledge domain ontologies. The article presents an analysis of unified structures for abstract knowledge classes in ontologies used to represent certain types of complex entities in subject areas. Descriptions of such entities are given for several general cases of ontologies. In these cases, the embedding of complex semantic representations into knowledge domain ontologies is applied. The indicated cases are associated with the processes of knowledge synthesis, which represent the implementation of cognitive goals. The paper presents examples of classes and relationships in ontologies of abstract and subject knowledge, providing solutions to professional problems: of managing the synthesis of complex objects, achieving the goals of complex systems, as well as developing areas of knowledge based on the evolution of ideas about the content and essence of such areas. Application of the proposed principles and approaches to modeling intelligent systems as subjects of knowledge areas operating within the framework of such areas is introduced.</p>

     <p>The article provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the principal dominance-based ranking algorithms used in multi-criteria optimization with genetic algorithms. Four fundamentally different approaches are examined: the classic pairwise comparison method; KD-trees built after an initial sort by a single criterion; a variant of the KD-tree approach that employs a linear-time median-finding algorithm; and the recursive "divide-and-conquer" method. For each algorithm, asymptotic estimates of time complexity and memory usage are derived and justified, and their dependence on the population size is demonstrated.
     In the methodology section, the author's system for generating synthetic test samples is described. It relies on predetermined a priori metrics: geometric balance (the ratio of points below to above the median along each axis), coefficient of variation, skewness coefficient, and normalized entropy of the point distribution in D-dimensional space. This framework makes it possible to model a broad spectrum of scenarios — from uniformly distributed samples to highly clustered or extremely sparse ones — thus ensuring reproducibility and objectivity in the empirical evaluation of algorithmic performance.
     The experimental phase comprises a series of trials on populations of fixed size (N = 200) over 54 combinations of target metric values (625 distinct test sets in total). Each test was repeated multiple times for statistical robustness, and the results were averaged. All timing measurements were conducted in a Python environment on a single personal computer. According to the results, the KD-tree algorithm with initial sorting achieved the best average performance (minimum runtime -0.0017 s, maximum -0.026 s), although its efficiency is highly sensitive to the input data's balance. The median-finding variant proved less dependent on distribution characteristics but, on average, lags behind the sorting-based implementa­tion in speed. The divide-and-conquer method yielded more consistent runtimes (-0.0123—0.0133 s), outperforming the naive pairwise comparison algorithm (-0.033—0.034 s) under all tested conditions; however, in worst-case scenarios it can exhibit quadratic behavior, restricting its applicability to large populations.
     The novelty of this research lies in the development of an experimental methodology for comparing four fast dominance-based ranking approaches in multi-objective optimization and in the creation of a test-generation procedure based on statis­tical distribution metrics. The findings enable a well-justified selection of the most appropriate ranking algorithm according to specific runtime requirements and input-data characteristics, and they establish a foundation for further development of adaptive hybrid methods. Future work will extend the analysis to real-world multidimensional datasets and explore parallel and hardware-accelerated implementations of the examined algorithms.</p>

     <p> Improving human-machine interfaces of intelligent systems is a pressing issue that involves creating user-friendly explanations of the results of artificial intelligence models. It is especially important for implementing intelligent systems with high responsibility for decisions, such as the power industry. The article describes a developed method based on the Shapley additive explanation algorithm. The proposed modification is based on: normalization of the feature contribution vector; semantic grouping of features; contributions' visualization that is different from the currently accepted one; and generation of text explanations using a language model. The presented method is aimed at reducing the cognitive load on the user when analyzing the results of intelligent decision support systems and increasing the confidence of industry experts in such systems. As an example, the problem of short-term forecasting of electricity consumption of an industrial enterprise is considered.</p>

     <p>This paper presents an innovative method for optimizing thermodiffusion calculations in solids using the concept of a thermal mirror and symmetry. The developed approach significantly reduces computational costs by applying the Delaunay algorithm and the finite element method (FEM) for mesh generation and thermal problem solving. The study demonstrates that accounting for the symmetry of geometric shapes and heat sources enables a reduction number of computations by a factor of 2n (where n is the number of symmetry levels) without sacrificing accuracy. The practical implementation of the method in the MFEMS system confirmed its effectiveness, achieving significant reductions in mesh generation time and acceleration of thermodiffusion calculations. Method limitations include imperfect symmetry of real-world objects, distortion of temperature fields under asymmetrical heat sources, and the high computational complexity of symmetry determination. Despite these, the method remains effective for systems with pronounced symmetry, providing an optimal balance between accuracy and computational cost. The results have significant potential for application in the design of heat exchange systems requiring high-precision and resource-efficient simulation methods.<p>
