     <p>The article examines the issues of developing rational methods for developing schedules (execution plans) of programs for processors with a very long machine word (VLIW-architecture). The implementation of the task is carried out on the basis of an approach based on the analysis of the information structure of algorithms and targeted equivalent transformations of the tiered-parallel form of algorithm graphs. The developed software system allows implementing various (heuristic) methods for constructing a parallel program execution schedule and quantitatively evaluating and comparing the computational complexity of these methods. Quantitative results of applying some methods for constructing rational plans for parallel execution of classical data processing algorithms on processors with an extra-long machine word are presented.</p>

     <p>This article focuses on the development and automation of software testing systems specifically designed for Automated Control Systems for Technological Processes (ACSTP). The primary objective is to analyze the debugging and testing procedures applicable to software-hardware complexes within ACSTp, while identifying the challenges associated with these processes. The study aims to enhance the reliability and functional safety of software throughout its lifecycle, particularly in critical infrastructure settings.
     The article begins by discussing the significance of ACSTP in various industries, emphasizing the need for robust testing mechanisms to ensure the systems operate safely and effectively. It outlines the risks associated with information and functional security, which can arise from software failures or unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, the research highlights the necessity of implementing comprehensive testing strategies that adhere to established standards, such as GOST R ISO/IEC 12207—2010.
     A key focus of the study is the comparison between manual and automated testing methods. While manual testing is often employed during the initial development stages, particularly for user interface assessments, automated testing is shown to offer significant advantages, including increased efficiency, reduced human error, and the ability to execute extensive test cases consistently. The article discusses various tools for automated testing, such as JUnit, TestNG, and Cucumber, which can streamline the testing process.
     The research presents a proposed architecture for a software-hardware platform that incorporates a semi-physical test stand, enabling real-time automated testing of software. This platform is designed to facilitate comprehensive testing across different levels, including module, integration, system, and acceptance testing. The architecture supports the execution of tests under controlled conditions, ensuring that the software meets functional safety requirements.
     Results from the study indicate that the proposed platform can effectively enhance the testing process, providing a reliable environment for evaluating software performance and safety. The findings also demonstrate the adaptability of the architecture for various configurations and applications within ACSTP, making it suitable for a wide range of automated systems.
     In conclusion, the article underscores the importance of implementing automated testing solutions to improve the overall performance, reliability, and safety of ACSTP systems.</p>

     <p> There are a large number of datasets on the publicly available kaggle resource, from which five datasets and their corresponding structures of artificial neural networks were selected. After training neural networks, the work of the neurons of the first hidden layers was reproduced in spreadsheets. A significant number of useless neurons were found (20—60 %). A neuron is called useless if the scalar products of all instances of the training sample are less than zero. The relu activation function converts negative values to zero, therefore, such a neuron does not contribute to the work of the neural network. Thus, it is necessary to learn how to find and remove useless neurons in trained networks. The following describes the principle of functioning of a reproducible neural network learning algorithm. To do this, the instance belonging to a certain class is replaced by belonging to one of the categories of ternary logic (true, zero, false) and a linearly separable subsample is formed. The properties of the Wide Learning algorithm are considered, the code of the first version of the software implementation is posted in the Github repository under the Apache 2.0 license https://github.com/brinkinvision/wideLearning. The scalar product of the input vector by the weights of the neuron projects the n-dimensional input space onto a one-dimensional digital line. The ternary activation threshold function on this line marks with true (false) categories a part of instances belonging to a certain class. The hypothesis of the normality of the distribution of scalar products of labeled instances was tested. In most cases, the hypothesis was justified, and sometimes it was possible to prove normality after additional manipulations. Once a two-modal distribution was discovered, the emulation of two-modality demonstrates the adequacy of the described methodology..</p>

     <p>The paper describes the numerical study technique for problems of external compressible gas flow around permeable surfaces applying a three-parameter RANS turbulence model.
     Numerical study of energy separation in the boundary layer on an impermeable and permeable plate with gas injection/suction in the range of Prandtl numbers Pr from 0.05 to 5 showed that temperature stratification increases with decreasing Pr number. Gas injection into a supersonic flow reduces temperature stratification compared to an impermeable plate, while suction increases the effect.
     The influence of the Prandtl and Mach numbers of the external flow on the value of temperature stratification, which is largely determined by the value of the suction intensity and, consequently, the total flow rate of the sucked gas, is studied. Temperature stratification is most pronounced for gases with small Prandtl numbers. It has been established that with intensive gas suction in the boundary layer on the section of the impermeable plate following the permeable part, the wall temperature drops sharply. The reason for the formation of a zone with a lower wall temperature is the laminarization of the boundary layer on the permeable wall with intensive suction resulting in the asymptotic suction mode.
     The conducted numerical study confirmed a significant decrease in the wall temperature compared to the temperature of the injected gas for both laminar and, to a lesser extent, a turbulent boundary layer with foreign injection of helium into xenon with a Prandtl number variable along the length compared to a uniform gas injection with a constant Prandtl number.
     The results of numerous numerical studies of the main elements of the working process in the energy separation device were obtained, which served as a justification for the possibility of energy separation of the gas flow.</p>

     <p>The article presents the results of a study aimed at expanding the functionality of the OpenFOAM graphical shell by developing and connecting an additional software module for the compressibleInterFoam solver. The features of numerical modeling of continuum mechanics problems on the specified solver are analyzed. The work was carried out to determine the stack of technologies required for the development of the module, a brief description of each technology with a justification for the choice is given. A separate section of the publication is devoted to the formulation of the goals and objectives performed within the framework of the study. To demonstrate the logic of the application, a process diagram was prepared, its brief description is given. The structure of the application is demonstrated in the corresponding diagram with a description of the role of each block. The repository with the source code of the graphical shell was updated with the integration of the created module, the results of checking the shell operation using one of the classical problems of continuum mechanics as an example are given, the significance of the study and the practical value for the user are analyzed. The prospects for the development of the project and the expansion of its functionality in solving new problems of continuum mechanics are analyzed.</p>
