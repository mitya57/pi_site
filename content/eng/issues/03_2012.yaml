     <p> This article contains an overview of the fault-tolerant redundant systems design techniques with an example of the original computer OVK based on the TMR (2oo3) hardware architecture. The overview includes examples of the functional safety estimation, failure rate calculations, solving of general issues related to the fault-tolerant systems design. The theoretical approaches are confirmed by practical samples of algorithms, protocols and other engineering solutions used for OVK design and implementation

     <p> In this part of the paper basic specifications of telematics systems described in the first part are calculated for random values of a push-out probability α. The problem is solved by generating functions. When the system capacity is equal to k packets, the proposed method allows to reduce the order of the system of linear algebraic equations in k/2 times from k(k + 1)/2 to (k + 1). The dependence of the probability of packet loss and network latency on the α parameter is analyzed. The results explain a number of effects that were observed in natural experiment, in particular the linear law of the packet loss in non-congested network, and the possibility of "blocking" non-priority traffic in congested network increasing the α value. An example of media traffic management is presented.
