     <p> The paper presents an overview of the LLVM infrastructure and its evaluation with respect to the specificity of compiler development for microprocessors used in embedded systems. It discusses LLVM features from the user's point of view, the overall structure of LLVM, and internal representation of a program.

     <p> Considered the problem of planning the cost of achieving the required level of reliability of failover software. Substantiated the necessity of the use of specialized optimization algorithms for solving this problem because of the large number of alternative options for building the software architecture. Described the algorithms of a software system to solve this optimization problem using exhaustive search options, or by using a specialized genetic algorithm. Proposed an algorithm for the use of tools in the software life cycle.

     <p> The task of automatic speech recognition has not decided successfully now yet. But products such companies like Nuance [1], Autonomy [2], and others are known now. The products are used in applications, and in Russian language ones. Hidden Markov Models approach is good for the automatic speech recognition. Mistake of the recognition system in low room in such a case become less than 15 %. There is one, but essential lack: the transition network between word models compiled by hand. But the process is very labor consuming.

     <p> Consider the method of recovery of BibTeX-structure bibliographic records from their text representation. Structure is recovered using logical rules defined on an expert-given set of regular expressions. Algorithm based on stub covers is proposed for constructing the logic rules. The algorithm is illustrated with the problem of searching the structure in bibliographic records, represented by text strings.
