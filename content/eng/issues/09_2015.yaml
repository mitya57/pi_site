   item_name: Combining Instruction Selection and Scheduling in Software Pipelining
   item_pages: 3–10
   item_keywords: code generation, software pipelining, modulo scheduling, instruction selection, Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
   item_annot: |
     <p>The traditional code generation scheme involves three major passes: instruction selection, instruction scheduling, and register allocation. 
         Separation of these tasks and use of heuristic algorithms for their implementation is quite acceptable
     in compilers for modern universal architectures. 
      Still such an approach may provide insufficient code efficiency for peculiar architectures used in embedded systems.</p>
      <p>The paper presents a method of software pipelining of loops by means of exact joint solution of the in
     struction selection and
     instruction scheduling tasks for cyclic blocks of program code. We propose an approach of treating the above tasks as a single 
     Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task. This allows taking into account interdependences between the three code generation passes. 
     The method being proposed provides a unified approach to various code generation and optimization problems including automatic use 
     of complex instructions (with multiple results), common subexpression elimination, automatic generation and scheduling of spill code, 
     instruction selection with respect to available instruction-level parallelism and data dependencies including interloop ones.</p>
     <p>Complexity of implementation and heavy use of computing resources makes this approach hardly usable in commonly used compilers. 
     Therefore the method is intended mostly for development of hardware accelerators and generation of high performance code for embedded systems.</p>
     <p>Possible directions for further enhancement of the method include restrictions on energy consumption in formulations of ILP tasks 
     and use of mathematical equalities in the process of code generation. One more perspective research direction is use of 
     constraints programming for specification of code generation tasks.</p>

   item_name: Relational Access Control Model Based on Chains of Relations
   item_pages: 11–19
   item_keywords: access control, access rules, access control model, relation, RDBMS, relational access control model
   item_annot: |
     <p>A new access control model is proposed for multi-user computer systems. Traditional approaches to the
       implementation of access control mechanisms, namely the discretionary access control, multi-level
       security, and role-based models, face the challenge of dealing with dynamic properties of modern 
       systems, including constantly changing set of users, modification of attributes of entities in the 
       system, and rearrangement of relations between them. Under these conditions, typical for systems 
       similar to multi-user content management systems [3] and social networks [5, 6], traditional 
      approaches may lead to an increase in administrative actions for managing the access control 
      mechanism and the access control rules. Declarative approaches, e.g. attribute-based access control 
      [1, 2, 7], provide the means to reduce the verbosity of administrative actions by using more 
      expressive logic to specify access control rules.</p>
      <p>The proposed model uses so called chains of relations between entities in the target system, 
       including its users and resources, to specify the access control rules. A chain combines a sequence 
       of binary relations by binding entities in adjacent relations. The relation-based approach maps 
       naturally onto the commonly used relational databases. 
       The proposed model maintains efficient computation of access control decisions while still 
       achieving sufficient 
      expressiveness by supporting combination of relation chains, transitive relations, and 
      attribute-based conditions.</p>
      <p>A formal description of the model is given in the paper. A property of model leading to 
      efficient computation of access 
      control decisions is defined, and a constructive approach to verifying this property is provided 
      along with the proof 
      of the underlying theorem. Experimental evaluation of the proposed model is discussed in 
      application to a model of a computer system "Nauka-MGU" ("ISTINA") [4] designed for user-assisted 
      collection and management of research- and education-related data and metrics in Lomonosov Moscow State 
      University.</p>

   item_name: Dynamics Control Computing in the Processor Data Flow Architecture for Different Types of Algorithms
   item_pages: 20–24
   item_keywords: parallelization of data processing problems paralleling paralleling automation, software and hardware parallelism, post the von-Neumann architecture, streaming calculators, of computing-intensive, computer simulation, strategy, controlling the intensity calculations 
   item_annot: |
     <p>The paper set out the goals of definition of rational modes of calculators post Von Neumann 
     architecture with automatic parallelization of hardware (streaming, DATA FLOW architecture) and 
     proposes solutions to some of them. Evaluators streaming architecture have undoubted advantage in 
     the form of a fully automatic parallelization of data processing at the hardware level and can be 
     considered as an alternative future of modern processors classical von Neumann architecture. 
     In contrast to the traditional architecture of calculators in this case, you can control the 
     intensity of computation (number of simultaneous operations), defined the conditions 
     for such management. Targeted control of the intensity calculation is useful in terms of rational 
     use of both existing performing 
     devices and loads (traffic) inside chip data bus and allows more efficient use of calculators streaming in single and multi-tasking. 
     Management strategies implemented by setting priorities sample ready to run operators from the buffer memory streaming command calculator, 
     with the possible intensification of regimes as well as the intensity of depression calculations. The concept of function computing 
     complexity of expanding its change in time of the program. These tasks performed by computer simulation shows the multiplicity 
     of solutions and the ability to choose the most effective one. The effectiveness of several proposed strategies for managing 
     the intensity calculation is shown by the example of several commonly used standard algorithms.</p>

   item_name: A Formal Model for the Floating Point Computations for the Dependently-Typed Lambda Calculus
   item_pages: 25–31
   item_keywords: formal models, formal verification, lambda-calculus, programming with dependent types, floating point numbers, floating point inaccuracy, formal semantics

     <p>The proof of correctness for the computational methods which are used in the complex physical simulation software 
      is an important part of the formal verification process for such a software. The high-performance physical simulation 
      algorithms are usually implemented by the means of floating point computing model based on IEEE 754 Standard.</p>
      <p>In this paper a new formal model for IEEE 754 floating point numbers and arithmetic operations is presented. The model 
      is implemented in Coq proof assistant. The arithmetic operations are executable so that it is possible to obtain the results 
      of computation in Coq. The model is abstract enough to be expressed in any dependently-typed lambda calculi with support 
     for the dependent sums, finite types with two and three elements and the natural numbers. The model is tested by comparison
     of the computation results for model and for hardware floating point implementations using the fragment of code from production 
     physical simulation package.</p>
     <p>The floating-point computations model includes the abstract interface for the arithmetic operations on some approximation 
     of real numbers. Based on such interface, the authors specify a simple language of arithmetic expressions with replaceable 
     implementations of arithmetic. By means of the language, the error which is introduced in the mentioned code fragment by 
     replacing exact real number operations with inexact floating point equivalents is justified.</p>

     <p>In the course of daily activities, one is confronted with increasingly volume of information, a large part of which 
       is stored in digital format. In this paper the MemoPIM system is presented. MemoPIM supports management of personal information 
       and personal knowledge and develops ideas of the Semantic Desktop <97> an approach to the personal information space organization 
       in accordance with principles of Semantic Web and Linked Open Data.</p>
       <p>Knowledge and information is stored in RDF repository, based on OWL ontology. Ontology describes classes from different domains, 
       such as file system ontology, publication ontology, calendar ontology etc. Knowledge can be imported from external sources or 
       created manually by user. System provides adapters for following sources: file system, email, calendar, browser bookmarks. 
       Imported information is transformed to RDF in accordance with system ontology. In some cases additional metadata is created, 
       for example author, annotation and title is extracted from scientific articles.</p>
       <p>During user work, actions performed by him are logged to knowledge base. These logs are later used for several tasks 
       such as context inference, knowledge base analysis and tag recommendation. Context inference is based on spreading activation 
       algorithm over RDF graph. Activation values for RDF nodes are recalculated after each user action. To create additional relations 
      in RDF data, knowledge base analysis is performed. Another service provided by system is automatic categorization of resources. Categorization is based on tag recommendation algorithm.</p>
      <p>System provides two types of user interfaces for knowledge management <97> based on hierarchical presentation of data and based on mind maps.</p>
