     <p>  This paper introduces a new concept of information security in respect to multitasking computational systems. According to the proposed definition a multitasking computational system is information secure, if execution of any application cannot negatively influence on other applications.
     Thus information security is being considered as protection of executing application and system programs from arbitrary actions of other application programs.
     Information security is provided by the software and hardware architecture, which guarantee information and functional independence of system and application programs and in time resource availability.
     A program is functionally independent if an execution sequence of program commands and a program itself could not be changed by other programs. This ensures integrity of programs.
     Compliance with there conditions is ensured by some technological and hardware means including static program and data allocation, separation of configuration and execution stages, special hardware features, minimizing the complexity of system programs.
     A computational system model is introduced for which functional independence requirements are fulfilled. Implementation of the model needs a new kind of hardware. Execution of some typical algorithms must be performed by hardware. Some computations performing as a rule by operating system are executed on configuration stage.
     The computational system consists of hardware, system programs and application programs. System programs nomenclature and their configuration do not depend on application programs. System programs and application programs do not depend on each other according to the data. A processor as a part of hardware can execute in addition to commands processor transactions, i.e. standard programs, determining computational process. Implementation of some programs as processor transactions allows to protect the computational system from uncontrolled interference by application programs.
     The model does not use any hardware means for memory protection. This is implemented using system programs. Planning is carried out by system programs. The scheduling algorithm guarantees the integrity of system and application programs.
     When scheduling, processing of application-specific data is carried out by processor transactions. This provides information security at the scheduling stage.
     The proposed hardware and software architecture can be used in information and computing systems for the maintenance of critical objects.
     Architecture can serve as a conceptual basis for creating systems for which information security requirements are primary, especially for those that function in real time.</p>

     <p> The authors of the article conducted an analysis of approaches, methods, and criteria for evaluating the design processes of onboard radio-electronic equipment. In particular, the key criteria influencing the enhancement of efficiency in designing onboard radio-electronic equipment processes were examined, along with ways to improve them when addressing business process reengineering tasks in design organizations. Based on the analysis conducted and the authors experience in the field of engineering business processes for designing onboard radio-electronic equipment for spacecraft, fourteen groups of quality assessment criteria for business processes were developed. The developed criteria were tested in evaluating the performance of reengineering business processes in the instrumentation department of the Information Satellite Systems named after M. F. Reshetnev Joint-Stock Company. However, due to the vast amount of material obtained during the research and design work conducted, the authors of the article have provided only examples of the development and coordination of the technical specification for the design of onboard radio-electronic equipment for spacecraft as indicative results. The results of the testing showed the effectiveness of the developed criteria for evaluating the design processes of onboard radio-electronic equipment for spacecraft, substantiating the potential for innovation implementation.</p>

     <p> Currently, the processing of search queries in big data systems is an important area of research. Its results find applications in various fields, including research, development and technological work (R&D). One of the main tasks in this area is accounting, analysis and promoting its participants through competitive means. To achieve this, information and analytical scientometric systems are developed to aggregate published R&D results. The article discusses a specific task arising in such systems, namely, the task of determining the involvement of authors in writing a scientific publication. Information and analytical systems store records of publications and their authors, but often there are no mechanisms that allow determining the relationship between the publication and the authors with high accuracy. The goal of the task, which is presented in the article, is to restore missing relationships. The algorithm presented in the article is based on the assumption that R&D work is carried out by teams of authors, and to determine the authors of the publication, it is enough to identify these teams. The materials of this article will be valuable to researchers and practitioners involved in automating processes within large information-analytical systems in the field of scientometrics and bibliometrics. Implementing the heuristic of authorship teams can significantly enhance the accuracy and performance of several similar-purpose systems, particularly those requiring real-time query processing.</p>

     <p> The article deals with the problem of calculating the volume calendar plan of a paper mill. To find the optimal schedule, a combination of the following criteria is used: minimal trim loss, minimal changes to the knives setup and smooth transitions by product grades. Solution algorithms are presented that use a combination of the simplex method, the column generation, the branch and bound methods, the greedy algorithm.
     The specifics of paper production and sales are taken into account — customer orders are measured not in the whole number of units of finished products, but by weight, which is specified with "tolerances".
     A variant of the genetic type algorithm for the paper production planning problem is proposed. The algorithm uses special crossover and mutation operators based on the multiple solution of quadratic or linear programming problems. The result of a computational experiment based on real production data of a paper mill in European part of Russia shows that the algorithm can be effectively used to plan the work of one paper machine for several shifts or as an auxiliary tool when devising cutting plans for a group of paper machines.
     The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution with no more than 400 cutting plans, which corresponds to approximately 8 orders for rolls of the same diameter and density produced on one paper machine. That is, it can be used when planning production for no more than two days. To build planning systems for longer periods of time (week, month), it is necessary to develop special algorithms.</p>

     <p> The paper presents a method for visualizing the interface, reflecting the business logic of user interaction with the information system. The presented method differs from the known ones in that it allows you to create an interface from the users reasoning, presented in terms of their professional activity. The implementation of this method is aimed at achieving cognitive simplicity and ergonomic properties for the user. The interface visualization method includes a description of the users activity in the subject area, its analysis and presentation in the information system interface. The key feature of the method is the study and formation of a description of the logic of the users professional actions performed in the subject area, as well as its presentation in the user interface of the information system in the form of a task map. This approach makes it possible to consider the context of the users activity as a whole and create a user interface that best suits the activity in question, which will make the interface more user-friendly. This determines the scientific and practical significance of the method in relation to other approaches that take into account not the general context of the users professional activity, but only its individual aspects.</p>
