     <p>The article discusses some of the innovations of the C23 standard that are relevant to programmers. Tests have been proposed and implemented to verify these innovations on the latest (at the time of writing) version of the popular GCC and clang compilers. A forecast is made regarding the further standardization of the C language.
     It can be noted that the GCC and clang compilers mainly support the C23 standard. Some inconsistencies and problems were found. If we try to somehow summarize the C23 standard with one idea, then, perhaps, this is a movement towards the "universality" or "self-sufficiency" of the C language. I.e., in order to implement in C typical tasks, you should have an idea about the hardware (processor and peripherals), the assembly language, the format of object files and the operating system. This is justified when it comes to system programming, but, according to the authors, there is another place for the C language, it is an effective (both in productivity and in memory) replace­ment for languages like Java and C++. At the same time, it is desirable that the programmer is not required to know anything other than the standard C language. Many of the features added to the C language by the C23 standard can be discussed from this point of view. Another trend that can be traced in different parts of C23 is the influence of C++. In addition to unifying the syntax in the form of new keywords, there are also more obvious examples of C++ influence. The future of the C23 standard is interesting. Each proposed innovation can immediately turn out to be generally accepted, or become the subject of long, lively discussions, or never be used by anyone. What of these features exactly will be successful will become clear in a few years.</p>

     <p>This paper considers analysis of user activity based on the event data collected by enterprise physical access and control systems. Such systems accumulate large amounts of data that can be used to profile users and detect anomalies — data patterns that stand out from the whole dataset. Detected anomalies indicate technical problems, incidents, or other security risks and serve as a basis for identifying security incidents. A simple software framework was developed to automate the analysis and visualization of data. Using it, it becomes possible to describe user behavior as vector data and perform their statistical analysis. The resulting vectors and their visualization can be used to assess similarities and differences in employee behavior profiles. This allows grouping similar profiles and identifying cases of deviations. Future studies imply performing clustering and determining typical user profiles and their behavior scenarios in "smart" enterprises.</p>

     <p>In today's entertainment industry, the rapid development of technology has led to the emergence of a large number of innovative ways to create visual effects. However, the task of improving the efficiency of work with footage remains relevant and in demand.
     To record an actor's performance, one usually uses either a photogrammetric setup consisting of a bunch of cameras placed around the actor, or a helmet with fixed cameras filming the actor's face. Despite the undeniable advantages of this approach, compared to manual animation, it has a number of disadvantages. These include the cost of processing photogrammetry for each frame of animation and the subsequent stabilisation of the actor's head position.
     Problematic issues related to stabilisation of facial animation are caused by the need to adjust the position of the head in each frame of animation so that from frame to frame the head does not change its position in space, and the changes would occur only in the facial expressions of the actor. Despite the widespread use of photogrammetry to capture the faces of actors, the process of stabilising the position of the head is still complex and poorly automated.
     In the presented article the existing methods of stabilisation are considered: interactive nearest point algorithm (ICP), alignment by key points, ICP with weight mask and Rigid Stabilization of Facial Expressions proposed by developers of Disney studio. Their comparative analysis is carried out. A new stabilization method is proposed in which the finite element method is used to approximate the flesh behaviour more accurately. The deformation gradient, skull displacement and flesh deformation formulas are generated to implement this method. The results of approbation of the application and comparison of the performance of the proposed method with others are presented. The analysis of the results showed that the application of the developed method of character head stabilization is effective and allows to significantly improve the quality of the created computer animation.</p>

     <p>The research is dedicated to the advancement of methodological and instrumental foundations for team formation optimization in software projects, particularly in light of the increasing complexity and scale of such projects. The issue can be attributed to the intrinsic complexity of establishing and resolving the challenge of assembling the most effective project team. This research presents a model for the multi-criteria optimization of team composition in software pro­jects. The objective is to provide the management entity with a set of Pareto-optimal project team compositions for the implementation of a specific project. The study reviews existing methods of team formation and develops an algorithm and a mathematical multi-criteria model for optimizing the composition of a project team. The practical application of the model is illustrated by a case study that demonstrates the Pareto-optimal frontier of project team compositions in the time-labor plane. The research aims to enhance the predictability and manageability of software projects by employing a scenario-based approach during the team-building phase of the project. This study is relevant to stakeholders involved in software project management, including project managers, human resource professionals, and company management in general, seeking to implement methods to optimize team composition in project delivery.</p>

     <p>The article presents the results of automation of the density continuous control process during laying and compaction of asphalt concrete mixture based on modern information technologies. The process of compaction of the mixture by the paver, accompanied by a continuous change in its physical, chemical and mechanical properties, requires the introduction of a continuously functioning subsystem for predicting of the value mixture density, based on the analysis of signals and digital processing algorithms, into the structure of the automated control system. Therefore, for the software and hardware support of the mixture monitoring density by using various indicators of the degree of compaction, based on the measurement and analysis of signals from sensors, a system has been proposed that solves the problem using a multi-domain approach.</p>
