     <p> The paper describes the implementation principles of integration platform for distributed intelligent resource management JSC "RZD" systems based on the network-centric approach. The integration platform architecture, principles of implementation, the DSL industry language are shown. The prototype of an integration platform is presented. This prototype of integration platform provides automated traffic control on the simulation model of railway direction between Saint-Petersburg and Moscow called "October Road."

     <p> The article presents a conceptual approach to representing Common-Sense Knowledge that supposedly allows to simplify this task. The approach is based on a symbolic model of mental images of prototypical situations. The key feature of the approach is its orientation towards pragmatics of knowledge. By means of this, precise definition of notions' semantics is not necessary within the approach. An informal description of the concept and a simple compu-tational model implementing the approach are presented.

     <p> The paper reviews the main tasks that were being solved at the initial stage of the computer networks development, where the nodes were used for processing in real-time the radar data of the air defense moving objects. The difficulties, that arise in connection with the above mentioned, and the concept, adopted in the 1960s, of the real-time operating systems software design for the control of the data processing processes are described. The airborne objects radar data processing and transmission throughout the global air defense network system software architecture is provided.
