     <p> The article is mainly focused on task of automation of transferring source code between two library environments. The classification of typical library entities having strong impact to software characteristics is defined. Special program annotation language (PanLang) is introduced. The problem of semantic conformance of source and target libraries' specifications is posed. Considered approach provides usage of special model of source code. Therefore after semantic conformance is proved, special transformation rules may be applied to mentioned model. These rules are based on both source and target partial specifications which guarantee correctness of result software. A simple prototype migration tool based on proposed approach is described.

     <p> In the paper we present an approach to modeling of large many cores cluster system consisting of several multi-core computers connected with high speed networks. A simulation solution, testing environment and methods of running tests are described. We give results of verification of computing nodes and interconnect model against their real counterparts and propose several solutions to overcome limitations discovered and ways of increasing the accuracy.

     <p> This paper considers the extension of the Triber's intelligent driver model in case of vehicles movement on multilane highways. In contrast to previously proposed models, this model describes the process of lane changing in the maximum approximation to reality. This allows us to define additional delay in lane changing process, and expect the best match of the empirical data. Developed model was verified by simulation. Obtained results well correlate with data, which describes the effect of lane changing on the traffic flow.
