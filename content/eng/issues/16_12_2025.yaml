     <p>The implementation of machine learning models in decision support systems requires the improvement of explainable artificial intelligence methods, especially in problems with a high cost of erroneous decisions. In this paper, a new method for generating user-friendly explanations of the results of machine learning models is proposed. The main idea of the method is to transform the vector of local feature contributions obtained using the local a posteriori explanation algorithm into a fuzzy logic rule with linguistic variables. Representing explanations in the form of rules allows increasing the understandability and transparency of the model for users of decision support systems. The method was tested on the problem of technical diagnostics of transformer equipment on real-life datasets.</p>

     <p>This article introduces S-VAW2, an innovative three-level Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (VAW2) algorithm specifically engineered for online regression tasks. Building upon the existing two-level VAW2 algorithm, S-VAW2 significantly enhances its capabilities by integrating multi-kernel learning techniques with advanced data scaling strategies. This combination enables S-VAW2 to exhibit superior performance in dynamic data environments, where algorithms must adapt to continuously changing data streams without the need for full model retraining. Online learning algorithms are crucial for applications that demand real-time data processing and adaptive responses to continuous changes. The primary objective of this work is to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between S-VAW2 and AutoGluon-Tabular, a state-of-the-art automated machine learning (AutoML) system. AutoGluon is renowned for its ability to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and algo­rithm optimization, while delivering robust predictive performance across various data types, especially tabular data. The study evaluates the performance of S-VAW2 against AutoGluon-Tabular using 13 diverse tabular datasets. The experimental results conclusively demonstrate that S-VAW 2 effectively adapts to data heterogeneity and achieves competitive outcomes when compared to cutting-edge AutoML solutions. This highlights S-VAW2's significant potential for robust and efficient online regression in practical scenarios, offering a valuable alternative to existing methodolo­gies, especially when adapting to data drift.</p>

     <p>The article presents a hardware and software system developed by the author, which provides a procedure for biometric authentication of its users based on the dynamics of their handwritten signature. The apparatus of fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms is used to implement the procedure. The system analyzes dynamic signature characteristics, including pen coordinates, pressure, azimuth, and tilt angle. A key feature is the application of fuzzy logic to describe extracted features, accommodating the inherent uncertainty and variability in handwritten signatures. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm automates the selection of fuzzy rules and determines the optimal decision threshold, minimizing the Equal Error Rate. This approach adapts the system to individual handwriting characteristics, enhancing authentication accuracy and reliability. Experimental studies were conducted using the publicly available MCYT-Signature-100 data-set, comprising signatures from 100 different users, to evaluate the system's effectiveness. The results demonstrate a low Equal Error Rate of 0.28 %, outperforming several existing signature dynamics authentication systems. This achievement confirms the effectiveness of combining fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms for biometric verification. The system's modular architecture, encompassing signature input and processing, training, and decision-making subsystems, ensures flexibility and scalability, enabling adaptation to various application scenarios. The system is implemented using Scilab for signal processing and fuzzy logic implementation, and C++ for high-performance data acquisition from a graphics tablet via the Wintab API. The developed system holds significant potential for applications requiring robust authentication, such as e-commerce, banking, e-government, and access control. The low Equal Error Rate minimizes the risks of both false rejection of authorized users and unauthorized access by intruders, balancing security and usability. Future research will focus on exploring alternative optimization methods for further Equal Error Rate reduction and assessing system resilience to various attack types to develop effective protective mechanisms.</p>

     <p>This article presents a modern approach to developing a question-answering system aimed at supporting decision making in territorial governance and enhancing environmental and industrial safety in Siberian regions. The proposed system leverages large language models (LLMs) enhanced with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The knowledge base integrates heterogeneous data sources, including federal projects documentation, digital monitoring outputs, and geospatial datasets, enabling proactive risk assessment and regulatory compliance solu­tions for governmental and industrial stakeholders. To ensure efficient information retrieval and storage, the system utilizes a PostgreSQL database extended with pgvector for vector similarity searches. The LLM inference pipeline is deployed via the Text Generation Interface (TGI), with a backend built on FastAPI and a React-based frontend interface. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that incorporating re-ranking mechanisms based on token-level query-document matching significantly improves answer relevance and accuracy.
     The system generates responses in HTML format, allowing structured presentation of information enriched with hyperlinks to relevant figures, tables, and bibliographic references. When available, associated visual elements such as charts, maps, and tabular data are dynamically embedded alongside the generated text. This integration ensures that users can access supporting materials directly within the response interface without switching between different views or documents. Such capabilities enhance the interpretability and traceability of the provided information, particularly for domain experts who rely on contextual details and evidence-based insights.
     The intuitive graphical user interface further enhances accessibility for non-technical users, offering interactive navigation through complex datasets and analytical summaries. All components of the system have been designed with modularity and scalability in mind, enabling seamless adaptation to other subject domains. As a result, the solution demonstrates strong potential for broader application in public administration, emergency response planning, and risk management contexts beyond the scope of the initial implementation.</p>

     <p>The article presents a detailed approach to designing and implementing a flexible and extensible system for saving game state for projects developed with Unreal Engine. The aim of the study is to create a universal architecture for saving game state that can be seamlessly integrated into projects of varying genres and complexities, while remaining easy to expand and maintain. The system is built using Unreal Engine's native capabilities, including the C++ programming language and built-in features such as "SaveGame" objects and Subsystems. The presented implementation of the game state save system is based on the "UGamelnstanceSubsystem" class, which provides centralized access to saving and loading operations across all game levels. One of the key innovations of the proposed system lies in its modular structure, which uses actor interfaces to facilitate automatic detection and serialization of relevant game data. This allows developers to include new game objects in the save system with minimal effort, simply by tagging variables with the SaveGame flag and implementing a standard interface, with methods to destroy or respawn actors based on their saved state. The proposed system has been designed to accommodate a wide range of use cases from simple level checkpoints to complex RPG-style world persistence and serves as a solid foundation for future improvements such as cloud save support. The solution aims to improve developer productivity and user experience by ensuring consistent and reliable state restoration across game sessions.</p>
