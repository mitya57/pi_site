     <p> In this paper is presented the research of a mathematical model describing the process of modification of the information space of social-telecommunication system due to the focused information exposure. The contemporary system of mass communications is viewed by the author as a complexly structured social-telecommunication system where social groups of people are integrated with telecommunication systems in the multichannel informational paradigm. The author presents a hypothesis that the information space of contemporary society can be described by the dynamics of the changing of informational messages which are spread by the means of mass communication technologies. The problem of identification of the optimal structural elements of the content of a message, units of their measurement and evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the information space is solved by the author with the help of synthesizing the methods of structural and corpus linguistics based on n-grams, the approaches of cultural evolution — memetics, the model of language probability, theory of informational confrontation and the theory of system-cognitive analysis. The author defines the metric of the heredity content of the information space, introduces the term "power of information exposure" based on the evaluation of the changing content of the information space. The meme-gram model to describe the evolution of the content of the information space, developed by the author, is proposed.</p>

     <p> The problem of the development of specialized software, allowing evaluate colorimetric shifts arising in the design and production of onboard display systems, is presented. Colorimetric shift represents the chromaticity coordinates of the image set in various color models. Colorimetric shift is due to the mismatch of color gamut of various color models. The figures of color bodies of various color models used during the design and production of display equipment, are presented. Based on an example of specified chromaticity coordinates, are shown, the general rules of conversion options of color models that are relevant to aviation instrument. The mathematical equations which connect the chromaticity coordinates in a variety of color models, forms the base of the software. The scheme of the technological cycle of designing and manufacturing of the display means, is presented. The scheme takes into account the stage of product structural design, the stages of hardware and software products implementation, stage of technological preparation of production, manufacture and test products. Results of matching of color models physical processes inherent in various stages of design and production of display systems, are shown.

     <p> The goal of our work was creating a software analytical system to evaluate the reliability, readiness and maintainability and to predict the remaining resource of the technological equipment used on the dangerous chemical industrial facilities. We have developed the methods to evaluate the reliability, readiness and maintainability during both development stage and operation stage. In these methods we have implemented the models for predicting the reliability of various complex systems used in the chemical technology equipment. The algorithms to evaluate the equipment reliability based on the statistical data about equipment faults have also been developed.
     The developed models and algorithms are implemented in the software analytical complex which allows one to predict the reliability of technical systems at the development stage, and evaluate the reliability and the remaining resource at the operation stage.
     The database included in the complex provides the comprehensive information about the project and about the operation of the equipment used on the dangerous industrial facilities.
     The complex was developed with taking into account the technological processes used on the dangerous industrial facilities, the typical schemes of building them, and the requirements of the technical documentation. It can be used by the chemical industries in the Russian Federation in order to improve the reliability of the used systems.
     The methods to predict the reliability and the complex have been coordinated with the Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service.

     <p> Algebraic methods are an effective tool for the formal construction and research of a wide range of information systems models, including intellectual systems. This also can be applied to the logical systems of production type.
     In the last decade the author and his students developed an algebraic theory of the LP structures, which provides an effective solution to the problems of equivalent transformations, verification, knowledge bases minimization and speeding-up the logical inference. It is implemented in a number of software products that demonstrate its practical significance. This theory can also be used to describe other systems, that were not considered as the production systems before.
     Meanwhile, fast-moving progress in the information technologies increases the complexity of the solving problems. Computer systems become massive and distributed, which requires significant advance in the techniques of their construction and research.
     The previous article formulates an extended algebraic model which has a number of significant capabilities that cover the distributed production-logical systems. It considers closures, equivalent transformations, canonical form and logical reduction problems for the new distributed LP-structure concept. Current work complements this model by introducing the notion of the production-logic equations and researching them. The results of this work can serve as the theoretical basis for the distributed inference optimization.

     <p> The increase in the volumes and complexity of processed information makes the use of artificial intelligence systems more and more actual. In such systems, one of the most widespread knowledge representation models is the production model and search algorithms are based on the inference engine. In practice, obtaining information about the subject area status is time-consuming operation for many problems. The examples are the requests to the DBMS, the analysis of medical data or other complex sequences of calculations can be those. Often in such problems, the search for solution (or set of possible solutions) is performed in the absence of part of information about the subject area status. This circumstance requires optimal use of limited resources.
     There are tasks of control of complex objects with random processes (risk management, socio-economic systems), in which the control process is based on fuzzy knowledge representation model. For them, the result of the controlling influence can be predicted only with some probability. In addition, process of obtaining information that is necessary for making decision about the control action can be time-consuming operation. In such situations it is necessary to maintain or to bring the system to the predetermined state, spending as little as possible resources for time-consuming operations of obtaining the necessary information, taking into account at the same time the fuzziness of the relationship between knowledge.
     The complexity of the operations of data acquisition necessary for decision-making, leads to the problem of minimizing the number of requests for information about the subject area status during inference. This problem is NP-hard. To achieve global minimization there is the general method of LP-inference with exponential computational complexity relative to the number of atomic facts in the knowledge base. However, some of its heuristic modifications have polynomial complexity. The goal of the provided research is development of the approximating method to better minimize the number of requests performed in the inference.
     Earlier, the structural properties of partition of the binary relation were considered, based on which it is possible to select for the analysis such subset of production, that most significantly changes the rate of relevancy.
     This paper presents the method for calculating the value of the exact number of layers without cycles based on capacities of quotient set equivalence classes that builds as the partition of binary relations by unique right parts. In addition, this paper considers questions of the algorithmic implementation of components that are necessary to calculate the approximate value of the number of layers without cycles.
     The presented approach can be applied to accelerate the reverse inference in production type systems of artificial intelligence. It can be extended also to more complex logical systems in computer science.
