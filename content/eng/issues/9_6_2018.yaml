     <p> The article discusses strategies of load balancing in a heterogeneous computing environment that includes the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU). The authors used these strategies during development of a hybrid fluid model (HFM) of information flows in modern computer networks with complex topologies. The HFM represents system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from math point of view and a balance equation of informational flows that comes in and out from a corresponding node of a modeling computer network from physical point of view. Due to the lack of analytical solutions for systems of ODE, which are included in the HFM, it is necessary to develop appropriate software tools that allow making numerical solutions of ODE system in acceptable time.
     It was noticed that a computation time of modeling of information flows characteristics in high-speed computer networks significantly depends on distribution of a computational load between components of the heterogeneous architecture. This assumption was formed during development and using of the parallel HFM software implementation based on the general-purpose computing for graphics processing units (GPGPU) technology. Due to this fact there is a need to choose a data exchange strategy between the random access memory (RAM) and the GPU. It should consider HFM computing algorithms details and provide balanced distribution of the computational load between components of the heterogeneous computing system. This paper describes the results of experimental researches of data exchange strategies.</p>

     <p> The implementation method of application programming interface for industrial manipulator on the base of web technologies for creating distributed control systems is proposed in this paper. Topicality of this task is defined by necessity integration of a standard industrial equipment with external intelligent systems of control and data processing for automatization of complex technological operations in uncertain environment.
     The application programming interface for robot manipulator Mitsubishi RV-2FB is based on the popular software platform for development of web applications Vue.js and network communication library Flask as connected link between all modules of application interface.
     Using this platform allows one to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces which satisfied conception of real-time control. Herewith using Flask library allows one to implement low-level communication between user interface and robot manipulator and provides stability of the connection. Final link of implemented system is the program on MELFA BASIC V language executing by industrial controller CR-750D. This program is responsible for receiving commands from user interface, their serialization and execution by controller resources.
     Developed user interface consists of three main parts: users view implemented by components based on Vue.js platform; systems functions, implemented by Flask library and responsible for data transferring between system components; dispatcher (server), responsible for interacting of software part and manipulator.
     Results of research confirm that implemented application programming interface for robot manipulator Mitsubishi RV2-FB has efficacy and reliability for transferring control messages. Also it provides simple control of manipulator movement without using of operators panel or necessity of writing programs for controllers CR-750D.</p>

     <p> The article presents the results of research on the direction of search models, algorithms and software to determine the semantic similarity between two keywords. The methods which are used in the work are based on the graph theory algorithms. The document is represented as a set of keywords associated with the document. A measure of contextual similarity of a pair of keywords is developed. A keywords graph is constructed for a given collection of documents. The nodes of the graph correspond to the keywords, and edges represent the fact of the contextual closeness of a pair of words. The method of clustering of the constructed graph is presented below. The keywords included in one cluster have the property of semantic similarity, which is an important result of this work. Software implementation of the developed models has been tested on the collections of scientific publications keywords, as well as on the collection of posts tags in the VKontakte social network.

     <p> The paper presents a solution to the problem of estimating the forecast error of statistical probability of presence of a feature sequence in the objects verifying the model of the studied object domain. The author considers objects feature sequence as n-grams. The object is an n-gram of fixed length. A population of "mutating" objects, united by a given criterion (e.g. time), forms evolving multisets of variative power. With such formalization, a common element of two multisets or meme-gram identifies the presence of a feature sequence. The probability of such event is defined as a functional of the number of copies of a meme-gram. The model in which this axiomatics is determined is called a meme-gram model.
     The presented solution focuses on the issue of estimating relative frequency of repeating elements of multisets with the condition of possibility of forecasting their number only for a part of these elements. The proposed solution is particularly in demand in the field of creating knowledge representation models for self-learning systems in the condition of limited amount of training examples from the total volume of permanently changing Big Data.      </p>

     <p> As other technical universities, Bauman University is challenged with timely incorporating newly emerged information technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), in education and research. One of those challenges for universities today is implementation of cloud technologies to build flexible infrastructure to support education and research in wide area of disciplines.
     Since the cloud has become the primary platform to host IoT services, universities need to integrate cloud-based resources into the IT infrastructure to support student projects. The target cloud platform has to be IoT enabled: it should be scalable to be connected with many thing instances; flexible to implement new features and services; and simple to reduce the development time.
     In this paper we present an experience and example of implementation of multi-vendor cloud infrastructure to support modern research activities. Various cloud technologies implemented to improve educational process will be considered and some future work will be discussed on the example of Bauman University.
