     <p> The information exchange-as a way of interaction for participants in an Internet environment-is a fundamental function of a distributed system within the computing paradigms of Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Ambient Intelligence etc. Participants in an Internet environment are represented by software agents running typically on low-performance edge computing devices. Interaction is implemented through exchange of information collected by the participants in a shared information store that implements the «intelligence» of this environment. The organization of agents access to the shared information and of their interaction uses a semantic information broker that manages information flows between participants. With an increase in the number, diversity, and activity of participants, the workload on the broker and the data transmission network increases. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to reduce the workload by delegating part of the control of the information exchange to the participants themselves. The subscription mechanism is modified for information changes in a shared information store. Instead of the passive op­tion, when the broker must notify all agents who have subscribed to the information being changed, the active option is used, when agents themselves can check for information changes. A new two-component control method based on the well-known backoff algorithm in combination with the well-known adaptive strategy for choosing the time of sending the next request from an agent to a broker for the presence of information changes is proposed. The control capabilities are studied experimentally using a simulated Internet environment.</p>

     <p> The pandemic and the emergence of the COVID-economy continue to have a significant impact on the organization of labor in the industries of the "new economy", of which the information technology industry is a prominent representative. By 2023, a significant number of Russian, European and global IT corporations and small software companies are working in a completely remote mode — outside the offices and without personal meetings of employees even within the same software development team. This article presents the results of a European study (Dec. 2022 — Jan. 2023), covering the experience of 48 software development and IT support teams in companies headquartered in Europe: Yandex, Sberbank, VTB to Deutsche Bank, ATOS IT, Finastra, etc. The experts determined the level of demand for new organizational and production paradigms in software development and presented their ideas and forecasts on the development of fully remote software development as a new IT industry standard in the medium term 2023—2024. The results of the study are presented in the form of solving the relevant research problems and testing the hypotheses about the level of consolidation of new paradigms in the practice of leading IT companies and their impact on the corporate culture and business processes of IT companies.</p>

     <p> Processors with extensible instruction sets are often used today as programmable hardware accelerators for various domains. When extending RISC-V and other similar extensible processor architectures, the task of designing specialized instructions arises. This task can be solved automatically by using instruction synthesis algorithms. In this paper, we consider algorithms that can be used in addition to the known approaches and improve the synthesized instruction sets by recomputing common operations (the result of which is consumed by multiple operations) of a program inside clustered synthesized instructions (common operations clustering algorithm), and by identifying redundant (which have equivalents among the other instructions) synthesized instructions (subsuming functions algorithm).
     Experimental evaluations of the developed algorithms are presented for the tests from the domains of cryptography and three-dimensional graphics. For Magma cipher test, the common operations clustering algorithm allows reducing the size of the compiled code by 9 %, and the subsuming functions algorithm allows reducing the synthesized instruction set extension size by 2 times. For AES cipher test, the common operations clustering algorithm allows reducing the size of the compiled code by 10 %, and the subsuming functions algorithm allows reducing the synthesized instruction set extension size by 2.5 times. Finally, for the instruction set extension from Volume Ray-Casting test, the additional use of subsuming functions algorithm allows reducing problem-specific instruction extension set size from 5 to only 2 instructions without losing its functionality.</p>

     <p> The new syntactic construction for defining processing loops of collections and series of values in the form of expressions is proposed as part of the development of new programming languages and the improvement of existing languages. Its essence is to use index enumerators as arguments to operators and collection processing functions. Such enumerator-arguments allow you to express operators and functions for processing a slice/entire collection.
     Translational semantics of enumerator-arguments for indexed and referenced collections is given. A number of examples of using enumerator-arguments for comparison with higher-order functions and list comprehension operators are shown. It is concluded that enumerator-arguments surpass second-order functions in conciseness and readability of the source code, and are not inferior to list comprehensions operators.
     Further research is aimed at constructing enumerator-arguments of binary trees nodes using a parameter that is expressed as a number. Its binary digits are link ranks and uniquely position a node in the tree.

     <p> In this paper we consider the problem of detecting information about HTTP endpoints on the server by extracting requests from the commented-out client code of web applications. The algorithm that extracts commented-out requests is proposed and implemented. The developed module was integrated into a static analyzer. An experiment was conducted on more than a million web pages belonging to more than 50 thousand web applications from the Alexa Top 1 million list. Requests unique to the commented code were selected for each page. Then a check was made for the existence of an associated endpoint on the server for each of them. According to the results of the experiment, it was found that commented-out requests actually occur in real web applications, they were detected in ~2.78 % of all explored sites. In addition, ~40 % of them were marked as "live", that is having an endpoint on the server. Also, a cursory analysis has shown that such endpoints often turn out to be vulnerable. The module can be used as part of a web security scanner to obtain more complete information about the server side of a web application using the black box method.

     <p> Electroencephalogram (EEG) data can be used in many different areas. For example, for diagnosing brain diseases, in brain computer interfaces, for conducting various studies, and much more. To apply EEG data, a large set of different algorithms for preprocessing and analyzing these data is needed. This paper describes a software platform containing a set of tools for automated processing of EEG signals and their analysis, including machine learning methods. The platform has a flexible architecture and consists of modules, which allows it to be used for various purposes. Data can be obtained both from files and directly from the electroencephalograph device in real time. The graphical interface provides a convenient way to configure the modules of the software. The software interface of client applications (API) makes it possible to use this platform to create prototypes of devices that use EEG data for their work.
