     <p> We consider the following problem statement distributed computing. There is a dynamically generated set of computing nodes. At each node, such a computing task may be performed. Computing task is determined by the name of the program and command line arguments. The result of the computational tasks is the standard output of the program. On each compute node running the target component of a software system as a separate Erlang/OTP application. Such an application provides the ability to start a process, which manages the computing task will be executed and its result will be delivered to the consumer. The consumer has the opportunity to get a current list of nodes on which it can run computational tasks.

   item_name: The Optimization of the Synchronous Brain- Computer Interfaces on Electroencephalogram Canal Selection Based
   item_authors_address: '<b> Ya. A. Turovsky </b>, e-mail: yaroslav_turovsk@mail.ru '
   item_annot: |
     <p> The paper presents methods of training brain-computer interfaces (BCI) firmware to select a subset of electrodes from an aggregate, so that this subset forms the best signal/noise ratio for the subsequent spatial and temporal signal accumulation. These methods are proposed for three kinds of synchronous BCI: based on visual evoked potentials, sustainable visual evoked potentials and cognitive evoked potentials with P300 component. An algorithm offered to construct wavelet transformations of a specialized filter for evaluation of evoked potentials on the basis of analysis of the chains of local maxima and minima in the matrix of squares of the coefficients. The proposed approach allows to significantly simplify training system for BCI in case of position change of the recording electrodes, and, thereby, to increase the functionality of synchronous BCI.

   item_authors_address: '<b> M. A. Kolosovskiy </b>, e-mail: maxim.astu@gmail.com'
   item_annot: |
     <p> This paper considers the task of video surveillance for pedestrian crossings. We analyzed peculiarities of the task, proposed the structure of the video surveillance system, and described the developed tracking subsystem. We evaluated accuracy, performance and robustness of the system. The precision of tracking is about 92 %, recall — 75...95% and its speed is close to real time mode.
