     <p> The article considers the problem of conducting functional regression testing of XML message driven systems and its solution by automating the process of preparing test cases and analyzing the results of testing. The main goals of this research:
     <ul>
     <li>reduction of the time spent on the creation and maintenance of test cases;</li>
     <li>increase testers efficiency;</li>
     <li>increase in the total number of test cases;</li>
     <li>increase test coverage;</li>
     <li>reduce the time spent on the analyzing the results of testing.</li>
     </ul>
     The article describes the results of development of the tool for generating XML-messages and its applying to automate complex functional testing. Implements the testing method described in international standard ISO/IEC/ IEEE 29119-4:2015 testing method and based on equivalence partitioning for XML messages driven systems. Built-in declarative language gives the test developer ability to describe equivalence partitions for XML-messages with different structure and different content. The language allows describing data sources for elements and attributes of XML messages. For each element, both limits and dependences can be set. The tool allows one to generate XML messages based on XSD schemas using elements values that matched the equivalence partitions description from selected data sources. It gives ability to create numerous different test cases for current state of normative-reference data in testing system. The developed tool can be widely used for testing XML message driven systems.</p>

     <p> Currently various applications encounter a task of extracting various data from the web sites. The first step to solve this task is extraction of all URLs from the web site being analyzed. Modern web sites are usually interactive, where interactivity means that the site can listen to events generated by user and respond to them. The most important event is clicking the left mouse button. To obtain the most complete collection of URLs one should click a certain sequence of buttons on the web page, which may cause a new block containing new URLs to be dynamically inserted. In other words, to obtain the most complete collection of URLs one should develop an algorithm that emulates actions of a user. This article presents model views, algorithms and software that emulates mouse clicks by a user. It also presents a business process model for algorithms and software using which one may automatically navigate within a page. Web pages may contain buttons of two types: clicking on the button either opens a new page, or modifies the current page by evaluating JavaScript. The navigating algorithm ignores the first type and only deals with the second type of buttons. The algorithm presented in this articles is intended to work with the following assumptions.
     The implementation should automatically detect the buttons of second type on the page and automatically choose a sequence of buttons to be clicked on. The algorithm takes into account that as a consequence of clicking old buttons may disappear and new buttons may appear. If some button was present and then disappeared without being clicked, the memory of the implementation will contain a path using which the implementation will later come into state when this button was present and click it.</p>

     <p> Information technologies are used in many fields of human activity. They greatly simplifies many of the processes. Russian Academy of Sciences has a great need for various information systems. The Academy creates scientific knowledge, which requires accounting and systematization. There is also need to build various reports on the basis of recorded data. There are many different auxiliary tasks, which can also be automated using information systems. Such systems are built on web-based internet technology. It allows to use them without installing additional software on computers and mobile devices. The article discusses one approach to the development of a system of sites, combined into a single information space. The implementation of the system "Information space of the Ural branch of RAS" is considered. Key features are high degree of code reuse and automatic generation of HTML pages.

     <p> The article presents a model and an algorithm for predicting the number of copies of a meme in the future content of the societys information space (IP). Authors presents 
     a hypothesis that the information space of contemporary society can be described by the dynamics of changing of informational messages, which are spread by the means 
     of mass communication technologies. The prediction period of the model is one calendar week for every three values of number of meme copies in three previous weeks. 
     The model is statistical and was made based on the analysis of changes in the content of Russian-speaking segment of information space from May to August 2014 presented 
     by a collection of time-varying text corpuses which were generated from 300 000 most cited in social media publications of various Internet media. In the article authors 
     evaluate the quality of the model, which show the probability of errors in the forecast of number of copies of a meme. A special feature of the algorithm is the possibility 
     of its application for prediction of number of meme copies for any IP with similar size and diversity parameters to the Russian segment of IP. The results of the study 
     can be summarized in the following statements:
     <ol>
     <li>based on the analysis of the changes dynamics in the number of 200 000 bigrams copies or memes (training sample), we have 
     developed a mathematical model that solves the problem of predicting the number of meme copies in IP for the next weekly interval depending on the change in the number of 
     copies of the meme in the 3 previous weekly intervals;</li>
     <li>a theorem on the distribution of the number of meme copies in the next discrete period of time p + 1 has been produced and proved;</li>
     <li>validation of the constructed statistical model of the number of meme copies distribution in the next discrete moment of time on real data showed a high 
     accuracy of the actual values of the response within the given 95 % confidence intervals with an average error of less than 1 %.</li>
     </ol> Quality assessment of the developed model (algorithm) has been obtained as a result of conducting 100,000 experiments to forecast the number of copies of a meme in the control sample (validation set).

     <p> Currently, there are, in the open access, various geoinformation systems that allow one to build routes for moving with in a city by public transport, as well as provides information about the location of public transport at the current time. A significant drawback of such systems is that the building of routes does not take into account the current situation on the roads, and also does not use the geolocation data of transport. This article presents a developed geolocation system that allows to build city movement routes taking into account geolocation data. The demo version of the system is available at http://gsmd.000webhostapp.com/www/index.php.
