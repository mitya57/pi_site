     <p> The methodical issues of the configuration management organization within the collective production of big real-time software systems are briefly outlined. The outline is based on the analysis of standards and author's experience obtained while developing such systems. Special attention is paid to the quality assurance and software testing, as well as documenting, archiving and contribution to an end-user.

     <p> An article is dedicated to 90-year of birth day of academician of NAN Ukraine and USSR Victor Michalovich Gluchkov, to his deposit in development of technology of ECM, computer systems and programs. In the 70-years of past century he foresaw, that the factories of computers, systems and programs, which will work on principle of assembling will appear, as in motor-car industrial factory of Ford. In course of time his foresight were justified. Offered them technologies are adequate to technologies, which appeared simultaneously in Computer Sciences. One of technologies — Software Engineering technology of programming is identical. Developing the Gluchkov's ideas, the author realized the technology of assembling ready components for the heterogeneous systems and gave a new classification of SE disciplines, oriented on industry of software products on the factory.

   item_annot: |
     <p> The paper describes new approach of morphological analysis implementation. It is based on dictionaries, but uses bitmaps for data indexing and searching inside dictionaries. It doesn't allow to improve analysis quality and speed, but it allows to process words which contains errors and misprints.
