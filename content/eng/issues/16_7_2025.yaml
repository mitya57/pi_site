     <p>The paper considers the task of motion path planning for inboard space flying robots in a virtual environment with static and dynamic obstacles. This task involves a three-dimensional map construction of the virtual scene, as well as finding the robot's path based on this map. An approach was developed for mapping that uses bounding volumes surrounding the geometry of objects, as well as bounding boxes aligned along the world coordinate system axes. Based on this approach, original algorithms have been developed for constructing and updating a scene map with the implementation of fast intersection tests between containers and map cells. In turn, pathfinding of robot's motion with an adaptation of the heuristic algorithm A* for the three-dimensional case is proposed that is based on the representation of map in the form of a regular decomposition graph. In the proposed solution, path graph nodes are formed dynamically, and obstacle nodes are processed using special sets with their updating taking into account map changes. The approbation of the developed algorithms and approaches was carried out in virtual environment complex and showed their effectiveness and adequacy for real time inboard space flying robots motion simulation without collision with obstacles.</p>

     <p> In the context of rapid digital technology development and the growing volume of educational materials, ensuring interdisciplinary consistency in academic courses has become a critically important task for higher education institutions. The annual increase in digital data within educational systems underscores the need to develop effective methods for processing and analyzing curricula. Interdisciplinary consistency in an educational program involves creating coherent and logically sequential content across different courses, including identifying common themes, eliminating redundancy, and ensuring the correct sequence of material (e.g., introducing basic concepts before more complex ones). This consistency enhances the quality of IT specialist training, en­suring their competitiveness in the labor market, where professionals with comprehensive knowledge and skills are in high demand. A key step toward achieving this goal is automating the process of extracting key concepts from course syllabi. Key concepts are high-level ideas reflecting the core content of an academic discipline, which can be used to analyze connections between courses within an educational program. However, existing key concept extraction methods have significant limitations. For example, statistical approaches like TF-IDF, based on word frequency, cannot differentiate between different meanings of a polysemous term or account for semantic relationships between concepts. Graph-based methods like PageRank focus on structural relationships between words but often ignore their contextual meaning. These shortcomings are particularly evident when analyzing educational texts, where the same concept may be interpreted differently depending on the discipline or section of the syllabus. To overcome these limitations, a hybrid method called ContextualRank is proposed, combining semantic and contextual similarity analysis using pre-trained language models such as BERT and T5. This approach considers not only frequency characteristics and structural relationships but also the contextual usage of key concepts, making it more effective for analyzing course syllabi. The method uses a graph model with edge weights calculated through a combination of cosine similarity of vector representations and contextual metrics, along with the TextRank algorithm for concept ranking. To assess the relevance of key concepts to course objectives, a mechanism for analyzing direct and transitive connections was implemented using the Floyd—Warshall algorithm. Experiments conducted on data from Perm National Research Polytechnic University demonstrated that ContextualRank outperforms TF-IDF by 21 % in F-measure, achieving a precision of 0.7 and a recall of 0.93. Results were visualized as graphs highlighting key concepts and their connections to course objectives. The study demonstrates the potential of the method for automating the analysis of curricula, improving their structure, and adapting to dynamic labor market requirements.</p>

     <p>Traffic congestion analysis and traffic data extraction are key tasks for efficient traffic flow management in modern cities. This paper presents a system that combines automated data collection and processing from map services for subsequent analysis of road network graphs. The proposed method extracts information about traffic congestion using image processing of map services, which makes it independent of proprietary data sources.
     The approach is based on automated collection of map screenshots, parallel image processing and matching of the obtained information with road network graphs. At the processing stage, filtering by color ranges, selecting road segments and their mapping to the corresponding network segments are applied. Parallel execution of operations is used to increase efficiency, and validation and repeated query mechanisms are implemented to minimize errors.
     Experimental testing on the data of a large city showed that the method allows obtaining a detailed picture of traffic congestion, taking into account both temporal and spatial factors. The developed module can be used for traffic flow studies, traffic modeling and decision support in urban mobility. The main results are accurate identification of road segments with different degrees of congestion and their correct linking to the street network graph. The system has demonstrated its applicability for analyzing urban infrastructure and can be adapted to work with various map services, providing a wide range of opportunities for further research and practical use.</p>

     <p> A brief analysis of domestic and foreign publications on the topic of time management for students is given. It is shown that almost all articles are characterized by a humanitarian focus. Automation issues are not considered. Several popular time management applications are analyzed. It is proven that due to their algorithmically implemented features, they have limited application when used for a student audience. The main functional requirements for a specialized time management application for students are formulated. Conceptual design solutions for software (SW) aimed at implementing basic student tasks are presented. <p>
