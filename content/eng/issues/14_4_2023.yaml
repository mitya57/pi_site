     <p> The analytical model of processing a batch of similar requests in a multithreaded server is considered. The model is based on the high determinism of the duration of individual stages of request processing and the moments of events leading to the switching of the processor from one processing program thread to another. Unlike other deterministic models based on the theory of schedules, in this case the goal is not to find the optimal distribution of work across processors, but to study the dependence of the main characteristics of the software server (packet processing time, marginal performance) on the characteristics of the request and the size of the batch. The model concerns the situa­tion when distributed system with intensive flows of information queries is developed and special measures to ensure the required performance must be taken. One of these measures is the introduction of batch query processing tools, allowing an array of similar information queries to be processed in a single service call. The introduction of such tools usually allows you to repeatedly increase the rate of processing queries in the system and very often becomes a real «lifesaver» for customers who issue, for example, hundreds of thousands of queries per day or more. It is quite likely that a sequence of ordinary single queries cannot provide a solution, and batch processing simply has no alternative</p>

     <p> Programming language compilers are complex software projects, the quality of which directly affects the quality of programs created by them. Therefore, compilers are subject to increased requirements for such software quality characteristics as functional suitability, reliability, performance level, safety, etc. To ensure quality, various methods are used: user and manual testing, tools for automatic error detection. And due to many methods of searching for bugs often situations arise when the same error, especially if its cause is trivial, is detected repeatedly, and the test cases that lead to it can be completely different from each other. Such test cases are called duplicates, and their determination is an urgent and acute problem, since their manual search requires a large amount of human resources. Algorithms for automatically finding duplicates would greatly simplify the process of developing and maintaining a compiler.
     The main idea of the approach for finding duplicates presented in the article is that the causes of the same errors are located in the same place in the compiler source code. To search for this place, the method of generating witness programs is used: for each test program containing an error, similar programs are generated that do not contain it. After that, metrics are calculated based on the source code coverage of the compiler and a list of source code files that are potentially causing the compiler to fail is formed. If these lists for two test programs are similar in terms of the proximity metric, then the test programs are considered duplicates.
     The proposed approach was developed and implemented for the compiler of the Kotlin programming language. Testing has shown the applicability of the proposed approach for solving the problem of finding duplicate errors of compilers of programming languages </p>

     <p> A method is described for checking of calculations on whether functions belong to the class of self-dual with using well-known linear codes for preliminary compression of signals from the outputs of combinational devices in order to reduce the number of controlled signals. A generalized structure for organizing the checking of calculations with signal compression using arbitrary separable codes is proposed, which complements the well-known structures of self-dual check of parity calculations («self-dual parity») and self-dual check with duplication of each function («self-dual duplication))). In the concurrent error-detection circuit according to the presented method, all devices, except for the self-dual complement block, are standardized (typical). Therefore, to synthesize the concurrent error-detection circuit, it is necessary to obtain only the structure of this block in the selected elemental basis. The article presents a technique for synthesizing a block of self-dual complement when organizing the checking of calculations using arbitrary separable codes. Examples of the implementation of devices with concurrent error-detection circuits based on well-known linear codes — parity codes, Hamming codes and their modifications are given. Some results of mod­eling devices with concurrent error-detection circuits are given, noting the advantages and disadvantages of using each of the codes considered. The results obtained in the study can be applied in the development of self-checking computing devices and systems.</p>

     <p> IoT devices connected to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud use the loT interface and the MQTT protocol for communication purposes. In addition to these basic communication tools, AWS has developed specialized services for transmitting telemetry data from smart devices. Firehose allows you to upload data directly to the AWS S3 data warehouse (cloud-specific file system). Kinesis service is even more powerful; it enables the user to build back-end data logic, which is automatically applied when data arrives. Also, Kinesis allows running analytics of the telemetry data using artificial intelligence techniques to discover hidden trends and consistent patterns. This article describes how to set up an IoT device using the AWS C++ SDK so that telemetry data it generates is processed by Kinesis services. The firmware of the device connects to the AWS provider using the SDK APIs and sends telemetry data as Kinesis service data packets; a Kinesis lambda function is created on the server side in the cloud to store the received data in S3 storage and send the data to the DynamoDB database after processing. Using Kinesis services allows the user to utilize all power tools provided by the AWS framework for processing and analyzing their data (Amazon constantly develops and enhances this set of tools).

     <p> The article discusses the methods developed by the author for assessing the proximity of the description of conferences in order to detect duplicates, as well as building groups of conferences. An overview of the existing catalogs of conferences on the Internet is given. Their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. The necessity of developing methods for more thorough verification of input data about conferences is substantiated. The description of the algorithms developed by the author and their software implementation and testing on big data is given on the example of the scientometric system IAS ISTINA. The developed algorithms make it possible to search for similar conferences by primary descriptions when registering a conference, search for duplicates in the database of the scientometric system, and combine conferences of different years into groups. The described methods can be used in the development of conference catalogs and scientometric systems to improve the quality of initial data verification.
